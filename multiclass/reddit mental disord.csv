I've noticed that while the comedown is still as dreadful as always, the comeup has a certain feeling of euphoria and clarity to it that seems to go away as I enter the peak, where the substance seems to just have the effects it was prescribed for back in the day (basically a catalyst for achieving a more focused state of mind), and even feel pretty apathetic, does anybody else experience this sort of ""comeup euphoria""?

In this prospective controlled study we tested the a-priori-hypothesis that central NET availability is altered in adult ADHD patients compared to healthy controls. Study participants underwent single positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging (PET-MRI). MRI sequences included high resolution T1-MPRAGE data for regions of interest (ROI) delineation and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery for detection and exclusion of pathological abnormalities. NET availability was assessed by NET-selective (S,S)-O-\[11C\]methylreboxetine; regional distribution volume ratios (DVR) were calculated based on individual PET-MRI data co-registration and a multi-linear reference tissue model with two constraints (MRTM2; reference region: occipital cortex). VBM analysis revealed no difference in local distribution of gray matter between the 20 ADHD patients (9 females, age 31.8?¡À?7.9 years, 488?¡À?8 MBq injected activity) and the 20 age-matched and sex-matched control participants (9 females, age 32.3?¡À?7.9 years, 472?¡À?72?MBq). In mixed-model repeated-measures analysis with NET availability as dependent and ROI as repeated measure we found a significant main effect group in fronto-parietal-thalamic-cerebellar regions (regions on the right: *F*1,25?=?12.30, *p*?=?.002; regions on the left: *F*1,41?=?6.80, *p*?=?.013) indicating a reduced NET availability in ADHD patients. None of the other investigated brain regions yielded significant differences in NET availability between groups after applying a Benjamini-Hochberg correction at a significance level of 0.05. Overall our findings demonstrate the pathophysiological involvement of NET availability in adult ADHD.

adhd,siherbie,2020/1/13,"Can regular folks &amp; even some of us stop pretending that ADHD doesn't have serious consequences for people suffering from it &amp; that ADHDers grow out of it, so it's only something that happens to kids. Today, I posted a pic on my wall stating the difference between what regular folks assume that ADHD isn't so bad, it's meds are fun or the age old toxic notion that we grow out of it versus adhd folks telling how it sucks to not have much memories, be forgetful at times or have a brain which doesn't listen to them at times. Seeing the post, a fellow doc friend commented that their pysch textbook states only 40% of folks get adhd into their adulthood or that adhd can surface post age 16 while challenging to show proof via research papers &amp; materials. Thus, when i showed some of the research material including those by Dr. Russell Barkley - suddenly the statement changed from only 40% get adhd into their adulthood to nearly 40% folks overcome adhd while still arguing that it doesn't have lifelong consequences which i simply countered by showing research that states that there's a strong need for life-long studies owing to lack of information in terms of onset of symptoms, quality of life and effects of co-morbid conditions further affecting the individuals. Sadly, his response was that i was arguing needlessly while my point was about people's misconception &amp; lack of information including the ones he mentioned while ignoring the points mentioned even in the MRI studies that note structural &amp; neurodevelopmental differences in brain formation between growing age which even if you don't understand medicine or neurology much - does imply significantly different brain formation &amp; potential issues associated with it, so obviously there are bound to be life-long consequences as well, much like Autism. It's such ignorance and lack of information that irritates me since I take my medication responsibly, work hard on myself and since i struggle at times - ask for accommodations since i do have difficulties &amp; not bcoz i am trying to be a junkie or lazy. Not to mention, looking at some of the rural mental health awareness project data that i am working on - i can see folks getting undiagnosed or even after diagnosis, quitting treatment that can really improve their quality of life. No wonder, Dr. Russell Barkley correctly said that ADHD is a social liability, much like diabetes due to its impact on folks suffering from it &amp; people living with the ADHDers.

Tl;dr - posted a pic stating difference between people's notion of adhd vs how it feels. A doc friend responded by saying that only 40% folks get adult adhd and after presenting research, changed his tune to nearly 40% grow out of adhd which i know isn't true &amp; these 40% folks have built coping mechanisms, just like folks on therapy or can't be on medication - doesn't mean their adhd goes away, they just get better at managing &amp; masking it. This irritates me when folks refuse to acknowledge that adhd isn't very serious and is no big deal despite significant research showing how quality of life deteriorates without timely therapy, mismanagement &amp; diagnosis leading to a life of regrets, missed opportunities besides being prone to other much damaging disorders."

adhd,karlmarxisgoddaddy,2020/1/7,"Please help?  Imagine yourself in the body of a highschool  junior in physics class ,listening to your Physics teacher droning on the colour spectrum. Scottish Physicist¡­ Wait a second,  Scottish people are associated with sheep and sheep are associated with livestock and in a matter of moments, I find myself  having an argument in my head about whether Edward Elric or Tyrion Lannister is my favorite fictional character. Out of the blue, the argument in my head dissipates once I hear my teacher in a rather disgruntled voice call out ¡°Hey Andrew what did I say?¡± and an awkward silence ensues. My spontaneity and speed of thought  has been the greatest problem in all my school years , a byproduct of ADHD.

Scientifically, ADHD is defined as a condition where there are some differences in brain development and activity that affect attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity , but at the same time, ADHD minds are gifted with creativity and energy. While the first mention of the disorder came in the earlier part of the 20th century, it has been present since the start of humanity. While the scientific consensus is mixed on to why ADHD is present in the modern day, a commonly held viewpoint on the topic is adopted by distinguished Professor Richard Friedman, who argues that nomads who were more responsive to external stimuli, hyperactive, and impulsive survived and passed these traits on to the next generation, making the condition present in future generations.

While ADHD may have been present for all of recorded history, only in the last hundred has it been classified as a disorder. For ages, great men such as Leonardo Da Vinci exhibited traits associated with the ¡°disorder¡±, greatly assisting with his innovative thought and creative endeavors. While there is no concrete answer as to why this is the case, a leading viewpoint among scholars is the rise of the 2nd industrial revolution and the new age education system, which stifles creative growth and fixes lives to a routine 9-5 schedule.

The inability to conform to this system causes children and teens with ADHD to be scolded and berated for the tendencies associated with this disorder, making them more likely to fail in the future. As someone who is subject to this organizational structure daily, I would argue that the current system in place sets me up to fail, underutilizing my creativity ,and forcing me to do routine and boring tasks. In 3rd grade, I got officially diagnosed with the inattentive ADHD type and The psychiatrist I went to prescribed the stimulant Adderall, which fixes the issues by increasing latent dopamine levels; however, it contains a large array of nasty side effects. Hence,  my parents decided to forgo medication entirely, making my journey through the American school system a punishing ordeal.

Unlike in the past, having ADHD is more of a detriment than an asset to success. Instead of The boundless amounts of energy, inventive thinking and spontaneity , Children are viewed as ¡°lost causes¡± and have much higher rates of depression than the general populace due to underachievement in a system that represses their creative and inventive thought and enforces a set exact standard which students are expected to achieve .before coming to the realization that the outdated and the inefficient Prussian adopted education model was incompatible with ADHD, I constantly felt like a failure since I was unable to meet expectations I set for myself, and slowly began to exhibit symptoms of depression, as many people with ADHD. A stream of occasional negative thoughts turned into a river of constant negativity and produced a depression that I still lapse in and out of . With the increased rates of depression and mental health issues, individuals with the disorder tend to live up to 10 years less and experience a lower quality of life than the average person, taking home over 15000$ less.

As a society, we must foster acceptance of the negative attributes and emphasize the strengths of ADHD by removing the rigid structure of school and work, and instead form an environment that stimulates the creative  mind. If we could adapt a similar work/education model as Norway, which allows the school day to be much shorter and removes the rigid structure of life ,and if  such an environment could be implemented in the United States, it would allow students like myself to realize our full potential and remove the stigma surrounding the disorder."

Evidence from the documentary:

dropped out of high school, and even after missing 2 years, scored at college level on the GED

arrested for beating up another girl; multiple physical altercations

ran away from home

vaping even though she's an elite athlete, drug use from an early age

car accidents

needs a lot of physical activity and a lot of structure to stay on track

doesn't make friends easily; acts like she doesn't care about being excluded

can't remember details of the squad history and acts like she doesn't care about it

was the only one who couldn't learn the steps to the routine for the community fundraiser

the coach has to watch her set the alarms to remind her to ice her ankle, even though she's in pain

went to the wrong place to meet her tutor

had to drop one of her college courses; struggling in classes even though she seems intelligent; didn't know she could raise her grade in one class by doing an extra assignment.

took nude photos underage

mother and grandmother seem bewildered about how to help her, even though they want to

Hello, I have struggled with some things most of my life, for me the most frustrating is the fact I have great difficulty concentrating and focussing on studying for example, if I am busy with it for a while I just don't process it anymore, and remembering what I am trying to learn is also a big problem.

I don't have an ADHD diagnosis tbh, but I do recognize alot from it, besides that I just got a new psychologist who has ADHD and she also recognized alot of her ADHD in me making her strongly suspect I have it too, we are going to see if we can figure out if I infact do.

My question is have any of you found ways of dealing with the if I am correct more often occurring things with ADHD regarding concentration and focus and short term memory, so challenges in studying, as I have had this most of my life and it is so frustrating as it makes me feel dumb despite being more then intelligent enough to understand it all, I just cannot seem to concentrate or focus and get a book into my memory."

""It's definitely common knowledge that our skin/hair takes a hit (even our teeth- dry mouth accelerates decay) but the science behind it is that amphetamines cause oxidative stress in the body due to the rapid surge of cytoplasmic dopamine. Oxidative stress forms free radicals (unpaired electrons) which inflame and damage the telomeres that protect our DNA. DNA codes for things like collagen production, and over time if your DNA is repeatedly damaged through stressors (UV, oxidative stress, extreme malnutrition) and unable to repair it will result in an aged appearance. Unfortunately, it is not only the appearance but internal biological aging like hardening of arteries that is affected.""

""Firstly, if it causes the same inhibited reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine, then it causes the same oxidative stress reaction. A lower dosage would just mean it's happening on a lower scale, which may be low enough to combat or for your body to recover from, or it may be cumulative. We don't know, but we can be sure the same process is taking place based on simple pharmacology.""

I was wondering, does anyone on here have any experience with Vyvanse or similar meds and going to Japan? Did you end up bringing your meds anyways? How did it go? Did you change meds before your flight or did you just take a break from your medication while you were in Japan?

Also, does anyone here have any new info about Vyvanse being approved in Japan that I might have missed?

adhd,JWIV06,2020/3/19,"ADHD can be overcome (Change my view) I'm going to preface this by saying that I'm not trying to be a jerk, in fact, if you can learn to understand my perspective, it may just be liberating or at the very least set you on the path to liberation. If you are in any way offended by what I say here, just know that I am sharing my honest perspective, and if you disagree, feel free to combat my post with a counterargument.

My credentials: My time spent as person with severe ADHD symtoms, anxiety and depression to the point of feeling numb for many months at a time, being medicated on adderall, concerta, vyvanse, and zoloft (which of course helped tremendously at the time), and my ability to seemingly miraculously overcome my mental deficiencies.

First and foremost, the deterministic notion that we are born with a set of parameters that varies tremendously from your average person to the next, and that we can in no way overcome these so-called parameters, is absurd. What doctors will tell us is that we have natural chemical imbalances that cannot be overcome, and this simply is not true. Of course there are those who indisputably have physical and mental deficiencies, but I do not believe that personality disorders fit into this category.

Now, concerning ADHD specifically:

I truly believe that every symptom associated with ADHD, some of which are: inability to focus, disorganization, irritability, trouble coping with stress, impulsivity, and problems following through with plans, are all personality deficiencies where a person is the weakest. Maybe it was the way you were raised, or some other set of circumstances that led to your being this way, but either way, these are areas in which an individual CAN mature.

The problem is that \*I believe\*(I'm astrisizing this to emphasize that there is no consensus on this among scientists) that the neurotransmitting systems in the brain are feedback systems, and if their feedback is negative (or low), this can create a cyclical pattern of bad habits leading to low levels of neurotransmitters which makes the individual depressed, resulting in a low level of motivation, focus, general euphoria and confidence, which weigh the individual down.

As has been know for millennia among certain groups, thoughts become actions, actions form our habits, and our habits mold our character. If you want to change the person you are, if you want to improve, change your habits, this may mean a small adjustment for you, or perhaps a complete change in lifestyle. Keep in mind that your thought patterns are too habits, and those can be the hardest to change for some people, so learn to be mindful of your thoughts."

I just stared thinking about NOTHING

Regardless of how much my life improved during those 2 weeks (No imagining/going over scenarios/conversations (sort of like maladaptive daydreaming), work productivity skyrocketed from 2-3 to 16-18 hours per day (programmer), my house/room was spotless all the time, became very articulate, extremely social and anxiety basically nonexistent), I procrastinated until December to actually schedule an appt because I was done disappointing myself, and being in the backseat of my own life

I could sit and write all about how this disorder impacts my life on a daily basis (Male/25), but we already know exactly how that is, I went in yesterday for my appt and was prescribed Venvanse 30mg, I figure it's Vyvanse equivalent since I'm from Brazil

They are also handicaps, and that superhero comics etc. arose during the first half of last century at about the same time as or a bit after modern psychology/psychiatry was getting started, is only further evidence of this likely intentional correlation that would have been designed for purposes of highly profitable media of all kinds as well as the contemporary pervasiveness and detrimental influence of the psychiatric profession, which would no doubt feed off of and bolster each other through this unforseen but fundamental link.

The superhero/mental handicap correlation is partiularly evident when you look at who is being cast as Bruce Wayne in the new Batman movie in development (hint: It ain't Jason David Frank), as if the throwback to the old 'nipplesuit' George Clooney films with the [metrosexual boofhead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Affleck) Batman from the last two movies wasn't bad enough."

how do you deal with emotional dysregulation (if at all) and are there any steps I can take to deal with the outbursts that come with it in a healthier way (that may be better for my self-confidence)?"

Was watching this and got to thinking that our near constant fidgeting would make it harder to read our body language. Not only that but we probably develop different tics / give aways than normal people because of it. 

This article right here discusses how children with ADHD don't notice and pick up on nonverbal communication. Since we don't acknowledge and learn it, perhaps we display different nonverbal cues than neurotypical people.

adhd,0x1x1,2020/1/16,"Adderall abuse and ADHD After six years of abusing adderall, I am finally deciding to truly quit and reshape my entire life and improve my mental framework for the better. I¡¯ve just finished university after five years and have gained 75+ pounds in the past three years alone, spent countless nights without sleep, developed a horrible nicotine habit, and have become utterly dependent on stimulants to the point where I feel an extreme sense of self-consciousness without them, doubling and tripling my dosage as well. 

Having the prescription gives me a sense of security and warmth knowing as long as I have the pills I¡¯ll be ok. Although I¡¯ve accomplished some major artistic successes musically during my time on medication, my life has generally spiraled and I have lost control of my own willpower. Now that I am finished with my degree and it is the middle of winter, there is seriously no excuse as to why I need to be on this I cannot continue to justify working through mental snaps and feelings of patheticness due to my reliance. I have no dopamine or seratonin left to excrete and realized I haven¡¯t actually done anything artistically constructive in over six months (became very bad after finding out my s/o was cheating) 

I am honesty really scared because of the major lethargic and mental fatigue I¡¯ve experienced when going off it before - often falling asleep after only a few hours of being awake and constantly yawning while also being sore. If anyone has any tips or advice/experience with a similar situation please let me know as I am very strong willed and mentally ready for a change, and I have never committed to quitting before as I knew once I quit that truly has to be it."
adhd,RegularSleep,2020/2/16,"20M Newly diagnosed and struggling I(20M) have struggled with ADHD symptoms my entire life but was always brushed aside due to being intelligent but lazy(IQ tested this jan at 159) from a very young age. I was diagnosed with dysgraphia a few years ago and tested similarly back then, but that didn't come with any medication or treatment, mostly just test taking accommodation. It is very frustrating to be told you are smart but never have anything to show for it. This I went to get tested and finally got diagnosed and put on Concerta, but I still have difficulty completing tasks and getting motivated with my schoolwork. I hate having this label, and honestly even the knowledge of having such a high IQ, as it makes me feel like a failure and that I will never be able to live up to my potential. I breezed through most of school pretty much right up to the end not doing any work only fucking up my IB exams due to not having any idea how to actually study, and while I am very passionate about engineering and do fine in more advanced courses I tend to fail and do very poorly in the prerequisite classes(I.e calc and physics sequence) 

I don't know, I felt like getting diagnosed and medicated would make a much bigger difference but it feels like the initial excitement has worn off and I feel exactly the same

I wanted to start by saying that I¡¯ve been a lurker here for over a year and really appreciate all of you sharing your experiences. It¡¯s been very helpful for me to identify with and relate to you all to make sense of my own inner / life experience.

I¡¯m 37(M), and asked for a referral to an ADHD specialist a year ago and finally got a (remote) assessment yesterday and confirmed what I¡¯ve suspected / known / sometimes doubted for a while now. I¡¯m beginning to make more sense of my life now and trying not to blame myself for perceived failures in my life and understanding why some parts of my life were always so mind numbing for me, challenges in organising my day, and long term difficulties in relationships due to emotional regulation problems. I¡¯ve spent a lot of my life dodging my challenges and trying to play to my creative / intellectual strengths while avoiding paperwork, which finally hit the fan when I got my dream job as a university lecturer / professor. I felt I didn¡¯t fit in with all of the ¡®farmer-type¡¯ personalities and my world started to crumble as I worked myself to exhaustion fighting uphill on things I¡¯m not good at, eventually quitting. 

I¡¯m going to start my medication journey now and would welcome any advise or resources relating to installing good habits around schedules and organisation to make the most of the medication help. Here is a list of difficulties I have had and would really appreciate if anyone of you know of videos, podcasts, webinars on these subjects:

- follow-through on tasks
- creating schedules and forming routines
- self esteem issues due to fear of failure
- maintaining social relationships
- avoiding distractions 
- starting boring tasks
- procrastination 
- limiting phone use for unproductive things
- asking for help / accommodations at work
- perfectionism / anxiety due to errors
- all or nothing thinking
- self-acceptance

The fee for the contest is $20.

We      started implementing a policy of reaching out specifically to  groups     dedicated to connecting/celebrating underrepresented voices a  couple   of   years ago, and I'm glad to say that we have seen our  entry levels   from   these communities rise. We'll be continuing with  this effort in   order  to  keep trying to get as many people into the  national and    international  conversation on literature as we can.

adhd,thwowaway0,2020/4/15,"My experience in dealing with ADHD-I procrastination without meds I was trying to deal with ADHD all my life, but until recently i didn't even know that i had it, mostly because where i live not many people have heard about ADHD, let alone understand it. I've tried various time-management and motivational techniques and nothing worked, except for one semi-successful technique i want to tell you about. 

Whenever i needed to do work, i would schedule myself a 30+ minute session of work (either immediately or set a timer to when i need to start), and when i failed to start it or stick to it for at least 30 minutes, i would have to pay a fine, let's say $10, by which i mean i would just destroy a $10 bill and throw it in the trash. The whole point was to make myself feel an immediate loss that would motivate me to work next time, so i made it a point to destroy the money and not gift or donate it (because if you do it might feel like your money still went to a good cause which is the opposite of what i was trying to achieve). Needless to say it looked like complete madness to whoever witnessed it, so if you try this, i recommend doing it discreetly.

It worked for about 6 months during which i'd been the most productive in my life and earned the most money, also i'd spent about $300 on these ""fines"". After 6 months it stopped working, i honestly can't remember why, and i stopped using this technique and have never attempted it again until recently. Now that i know what ADHD is all about, i can see how it worked by making negative consequences of not doing the task immediate, instead of relying on a very distant delayed gratification,  and i can probably improve it to make it stick for longer (e.g. by using not only ""fines"" but ""rewards"" too), so I'll keep you updated."

Now that I'm home and have no choice but to work alone, I realized something - I'm fully finishing all my assignments and understanding the material in a way that I rarely usually do. Not only that, but I \*enjoyed\* doing them! It always astounds me how much better I perform when I'm confident in myself and am not comparing myself to others.

adhd,HapyAndrew,2020/2/16,"Why Gen Z and Millennial's are More Stressed Now Than Ever Hello everyone, I have been thinking a lot about how stress, anxiety and depression has affected mental health disorders (like ADHD) and how these symptoms are evolving through the generations. I hope that this post can jump start more conversations and can be applicable to anyone (no matter where you live). 

According to the America Psychological Association (APA), Generation Z and Millennial's are more stressed now than any other generation with increasing rates of stress, anxiety and suicide. And according to the [National Institute of Mental Health](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness.shtml#part_154785), one in five Americans will experience a mental health problem every 12 months, with work related stress estimated to cost $300 billion /yr for health care and missed days. 

Psychologists, scientists and technologists are all pointing their fingers in different directions for the causality. However, in 2017 the APA conducted a [stress survey](https://www.stress.org/daily-life) and found that the most common sources of stress were:

63% Future of our nation

62% Money

61% Work

57% Political climate

51% Violence/crime 

As a millennial, student of psychology and someone who deals with my own attention/ hyperactivity issues I think the US and the world may be experiencing a rise in mental health disorders because of increasing rates of stress and the effects of technology, new modes of communication, awareness of mental health and the idea that certain areas of the world are experiencing a ¡°golden age¡± of prosperity and now have the bandwidth to worry about the future. I think this is an interesting and weird time for all of us. 

I would love to hear your thoughts on if you think stress, and the advancement of the human species has positive or negative effects on ADHD."

I'm a 215lb male, almost 40, generalised anxiety disorder, recovering from a major depressive episode, and currently taking 200mg sertraline and 150mg bupropion xl (the latter stopping tomorrow when I start Concerta). I recently completely tapered off of clonazepam, which I'd been taking for about 7 years (0.5mg 2x/day); it was a hard process despite the low dose, and I'd been tapering since the beginning of this year. 

I'm really curious to know if others with a similar profile have any tips or experiences to share. I have to admit that when I heard about this possibility (ie that ADHD might've been a silent contributor to my long-standing problems), I was super excited at the prospect of fixing this hidden problem medically. 

Tldr I'm starting Concerta tomorrow and don't know what to expect!"

I've seen figures pegging ADHD around 2/3 the age of a Non-ADHD person. Then the ""Legal Drinking Age"" would be closer to 31 if compared to 21, with adult brain development finishing around 39-ish years of age instead of 26-ish."

adhd,DanKekington,2020/2/10,"ADHD meds and motivation I'm seeing a psychiatrist in a little over two weeks from now to be prescribed some kind of ADHD med because my concentration has only gotten worse as I've grown older and no matter what I do, nothing helps it get any better. For the longest time, I never wanted to have to take pills just to focus like a regular person since I didn't (and still don't, really) like the idea of being on stimulants long-term but at   this point, I've accepted the fact that this is a biological problem which can only be solved through medication. Another problem is motivation, I think because I know that if I try to do anything more   than just chores around the house or something simple like that, it will be almost impossible for me to focus long enough to make any kind of progress that I'd feel good about (e.g. writing, practicing guitar, etc.) so I just get frustrated and do something simple yet not nearly as rewarding instead because that's really all I can do right now. For those of you who take these meds, aside from a concentration boost, have you found that they also help you stay more motivated than you were   before, even if it's only a little bit?

It is designed to help improve aspects of your mental health such as concentration. While hard evidence for the effectiveness of super brain yoga is limited, some feel it can especially benefit hyperactive children and teens, senile people, autistic people, and people with ADD/ADHD, dementia, Alzheimer's / Superbrain yoga is a simple activity that involves touching the ears and doing squats. With a little effort, you can easily gain the benefits of super brain yoga. This is an ancient practice in India and is called Thoppukaranam for thousand of years . It is also a punishment of most teachers in school for kids who are misbehaving and it has shown improvement on they kids attention after the punishment . 
 
Research indicates Super Brain Yoga can have powerful effects on our brain waves.Specifically, data show about 15 minutes of Super Brain Yoga can lead to a spike in our alpha wave activity.

This is significant because the more our alpha waves are stimulated, the greater the cognitive benefits. Alpha brain waves promote resting alertness and relaxation. They also play a role in the occipital region of the brain, which oversees learning, memory, critical thinking, and more.

Accordingly, SuperBrain Yoga is also thought to affect the brain by:

Strengthening the immune system and promoting fast healing (due to the increase in alpha wave activity)
Reprogramming our state of inner consciousness
Improving intelligence, creativity, and overall performance
Synchronizing the right and left hemispheres of the brain
Our left and right brain wave patterns are typically in sync during any form of relaxation, including meditation and other forms of yoga.4 This synchronicity may increase our brainpower, helping us retain more information, and giving us more control over our emotions. The corpus callosum is the white matter in the middle in between of the left and right hemispheres which has different function. As it is shows in the chart the left hemisphere is language , math , science and cognitive skills and the right is i the inhibition, art and music and it is amazing these grey matter of the brain ?? connects in the middle of the corpus callosum that helps communicate between the two hemispheres for better cognitive function . I utilize this yoga practice whenever I have patients with brain injury such as stroke , concussion and any patient who are depress led or stressed out and it definitely works! 

 This is as per request from one of my viewers and if you want me to do a follow along video for at least 15 minutes to take a break from the screen ??, computer, sitting for prolonged period of time and needed to de-stress then try this and let me know leave a comment in the section below  and it will be my next future videos.

About 4 months ago, after 26 years of struggling with issues intermittently attributed to anxiety, depression, CPTSD, and just plain laziness/personal fault, I was diagnosed with ADHD and given a prescription of Adderall. Since then it's been a whirlwind of emotional realizations (and the euphoria of *relief* from my symptoms) that I'm sure a lot of folks here can relate to.

As much as being medicated has already made a huge impact in my life, it obviously hasn't magically fixed everything. My room is still a mess, I still struggle to consistently implement my routines, and ultimately, I can't be medicated 100% of the time (especially since I'm bad at taking my meds on time, lol), and my ADHD will never totally go away.

I've heard people say that the thing that really makes medication useful is that it allows you to actually do the harder work of developing good habits and unlearning the shitty coping mechanisms you'd previously been relying on. I want to start doing that, especially now that I have a clearer sense of what are ADHD symptoms (things that go away when I'm medicated) vs what are personal habits (things I still do/struggle with whether I'm medicated or not).

So a few years ago I began to avoid medication and tried to manage my symptoms autonomously, obviously my focus has suffered but I at least still feel like I am myself. I¡¯m starting to think that maybe I should revisit medication, as it could¡¯ve just been that those drugs weren¡¯t the answer or the amount was off, something like that. Can you share your experience with the medications that you have tried in the past and how it¡¯s worked, and what you¡¯ve found to be successful?"

I am an industrial engineer on my way to my second university degree (7 exams to go) in automotive engineering, but have gotten told by numerous people that I am probably more the practical guy fml. They all don't know about my diagnosis.  
I have a measured IQ of 138 and worked in a lot of trade industries. I do love oldtimer restoration and welding tbh, but also became bored in most of these jobs before probably indicating that I should go a ""higher"" route.

Have some of you, since working through and adjusting to their ""new life"", made the decision to go in a less straining industry, that maybe fits better their practical hands-on ADHD brain? I fear that I will have the same feelings (feeling not using all of what I am capable of)."

After years of wrestling the medical system I've finally managed to get an ADHD dyagnosis and got put on a generic version of Concerta, and that seems to have mostly solved the third issue, which used to be crippling. I'm getting seen for an ASD assessment soon and have been seeing gynecologists and psychosexual therapists for years... But I keep running into the same issue, no one ever has the knowledge of how those things work or how they should be treated in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, no one knows what to do to me. 90% of the doctors and nurses I've seen have never heard about something like this, and that's happening in one of the most developed countries in the world.

I'm figuring some stuff out on my own, but I just feel really alone in this entire thing and no one ever seems to have even remotely similar problems. Has anyone else ever been through something like this and managed to make the situation better? It's just so frustrating to have a part of being human locked away from me, not because we're not there yet scientifically, but because most of the people I've seen are just not at an emotional/psychological level where they can actually understand how bad it is or where they can see the value in conducting more research on those topics, I've had trained GPs dismiss my problem as just ""not being able to orgasm"". There are people that have amazingly fulfilling sexual lives without being able to orgasm and I know I am miles away from those people, but it never really sinks in with anyone... or I just get an ""asexual"" label slapped on me and get send on my way, despite showing clear interest in having at least a resemblance of a sexual life and despite the fact that I do enjoy those things a lot (at least on my own) on the very rare occassions when it actually works out."

I normally work a very physically-intensive, teamwork-based outdoor job that has the added benefit of being a totally fine place to put on earbuds and listen to podcasts if mental boredom starts to slow me down. I've been extremely lucky with the lockdown in that my employers are still finding stuff for us to make our hours on through telework, but it's all webinars and self-led certification courses where the only accountability we're held to is self-reporting and the only time we touch base with real people is through occasional skype meetings.

It's been simultaneously a very interesting experience and absolute hell. On one hand, having two hours of commute time shaved off my day and the flexibility to take breaks on my own time has really improved my overall mood and wellbeing. I feel like I have the hard-drive space in my brain to care about stuff like an exercise routine and a diet for the first time in years, and if anything having a little more free time and flexibility has only increased my interest in using my time well. On the other hand...my brain absolutely cannot handle a solo work environment where all the work is in front of a screen and there is nobody to touch base with. It feels like college lectures all over again. I'm able to deal with it a little by getting workouts or laundry folding in while watching the webinars, but I'm still really not sure how to motivate myself when there's no goal aside from putting hours in- I'm really only mentally motivated by jobs where I'm touching base with folks and feel like I'm serving some kind of bigger goal I care about.

adhd,asaragi,2020/3/29,"Pandemic Validation So there's been a lot of talk about people's routines collapsing from the covid-19 situation; not just within this subreddit, but everywhere. Even neurotypicals are falling apart without their schedules to keep them on track, falling hard into old/bad habits or just not really being able to take care of themselves.

This is probably only really relevant to my fellow ADHD introverts, but as someone who has been working from home the past few months and was unemployed before then, thus having no real schedule to speak of, I always thought I was a huge mess. But seeing people suddenly struggle so hard without outside pressure on them, I've realized that I actually have a lot more self control and willpower than I give myself credit for. I'm pretty well off for someone with basically no accountability; my sleep schedule might be a bit of a mess and I tend to procrastinate, but other than that I'm doin okay. I got my basic necessities and hygiene down no problem, I'm able to be productive every day, I have a loose routine that I can reasonably stick too, and I spend most of my time doing things that are actively engaging for me instead of just lying around wasting time. It's been a very validating experience for me to really see that not only is it hard for basically anyone to self-regulate, but I'm actually pretty good at it despite ADHD/executive function struggles. It's easy to feel like we have no self control, but I think it's easy to get caught up in what we struggle to do and forget to give ourselves credit for the things we can do."

TX can¡¯t fill controlled substance scripts written by a nurse practitioner, which I found out the hard way when I went home for 2 weeks and withdrew cold turkey while simultaneously dealing with the flu.

I saw the specialist today, and I left with multiple forms, two of which are going to be filled out by my roommate and my mother. 

Now, growing up, my mom always taught me to suck it up and never reveal your struggles and problems to anyone else to pass on that burden, so I've done just that. I never told anyone about my struggles before, not even her or my roommate. So they filled out the third person observer forms, and are putting things down like ""has trouble focusing and learning: 0 (never or not at all)"" when that's totally incorrect, I just never tell anyone about these struggles I was told to keep to myself :( Several of their answers are completely wrong when it comes to stuff they wouldn't know unless I specifically told them, which I haven't. They got all of the things they can actually observe down (like ""answering questions before someone finishes talking,"" ""fidgeting often,"" and ""blurring things out"") but almost all of the actual attention struggles I've been having went unreported on these forms because I never told anyone about them, and these two forms make up half of the material the specialist gave me to fill out, so I feel like my future is completely in the hands of two people who don't actually know how much I've been struggling all my life.

For me, this occurs on an almost daily basis. I will be going about my business, scrolling or cleaning or getting settled in bed, when a thought makes its way to the forefront of my mental train station and pulls the fire alarm. I take for granted the anxiety that never allows me to forget a few particular things, like the date of my first day at my new job, which is prominent in my thoughts every time the time of day is drawn to my attention. That anxiety could prove itself much more useful if it kept a detailed calendar with notes on bills and progress checkpoints to keep me on track. I¡¯m not sure that I will ever be able to remember all of the debts that I owe, and I¡¯m sure my memory in that sector is far more selective than it should be.

This was before it was normal to identify quietly inattentive children as having ADHD, and I later took myself to the school psychologist in college and got a diagnosis. I am still working to improve in this area as an adult, and I have found a few tools that help. Frustratingly, exercises in mental discipline fail to level the playing field, because neurotypical people get just as much mileage out of them as people with ADHD. In any case, I will continue to rewire my brain for better executive function. Here is a therapist's [pdf exercise on following instructions for adults](http://affiliatedrehab.com/ipad/files/JustforAdults_follow_directions.pdf). It is meant for treatment and not for testing.

I wanted to consult you about ADHD and replacement for Ritalin.
The goal I take Ritalin to be productive, efficient, without it being really hard to sit in the chair or really mess with what's important. Therefore, I use Ritalin to solve these problems, of course all this is done after diagnosis and medical approval. After a period of experimenting with Ritalin, I noticed that this drug very much thinking fixture, impairs creativity, impairs sexual desire, impairs appetite, and impairs sleep. I have tried other drugs from the same family and another family as amphetamines, but unfortunately they all have the same side effects, some less powerful and some more powerful. I feel that Ritalin is very helpful in sitting down and greatly refining my senses and ability to speak physically and express verbally and formally, but it greatly impairs the simple and beautiful thinking I have without it. I wanted to consult you. Is there any recommendation to substitute another drug? Or try to avoid the drug by natural alternatives?
And is there a chance that Ritalin makes me really sharp because of the drug or because those are my innate abilities that seem to be expressed as a result of concentration?"
adhd,regtucker,2020/1/23,"What are your thoughts on ADHD and entrepreneurship research? Recent research has examined how mental health might influence entrepreneurship. This research is in infant stages, but some studies suggest that some positives can be harnessed when examining mental health and entrepreneurship. For the most part, scholarship ignores the mental health community. As a result, there can be misleading messages in the media on how one mental disability or another is a superpower in the entrepreneurship context.

I am conducting a study that examines if and how useful are ADHD and entrepreneurship research findings to the ADHD subreddit community. I request your participation in this short study. You will be asked to rate how useful are findings from 8 ADHD and entrepreneurship studies conducted in the past and a few demographic questions (e.g., employment, age). I expect that the survey will take approximately 5-7 minutes to complete, but can certainly be completed in a shorter time.

Dr. Reg Tucker of Louisiana State University (LSU) is the investigator on this study and the study has been approved by LSU (IRB# E11150).

The link to the survey is below. If you elect to participate in this study I thank you for your participation. I believe this study will offer interesting insights as scholarship will take into account who all stakeholders are when it comes to examining mental health and entrepreneurship.

adhd,theliberalheathen,2020/4/20,"Sudden Bodily Tics I started noticing tic-behaviours in the last year or so. Sometimes, like maybe once or twice a week, I'll feel this tingling sort of pressure building up either at the front of my head or base of neck - its a kind of warning a few seconds before I compulsively tic. For me it tends to manifest in sudden head-jerks, snap-flicking my hands and slapping my head until the 'pressure' goes away, which usually goes on for about 30 seconds to a minute. It always takes me by surprise, because there's long enough time between these moments to forget that it happens, and most of the time I'm alone so it's fine to be a bit weird. I got the feeling a couple of times during lectures and in public though which means I was kinda restricted to just moving my head and straining my fingers/shoulders to try and mimic the feeling.

It doesn't really happen often enough for me to consider it a habit, I guess, so I'm a little unclear as to whether this is something to do with ADHD (primarily inattentive ADD for me) or something else...I may be doing other, subconscious 'fidgeting' things for all I know, but as per the definition, I wouldn't be aware of any personal habits like that. These 'pressure moments' or whatever you could call them, just stand out because as I said, they come on suddenly and I haven't really noticed any specific impetus for them, and the fact that I've only noticed it in the last year or so is also kinda weird."

I'm 16, I behave most of the time as a 11 year old kid when I'm supposed to behave like a 18+ year old since I'm currently studying university. I've had it easy with (most) classmates so far, almost everyone treats me very nice, they're great; but still, I feel constantly ashamed of my personality and behavior that sometimes it's not appropriate for my age, and even more reasonably because I'm surrounded by mostly 20¨C26 year old people.

Some groups are more quiet than others, but generally in the more quiet ones, I feel the urge to make jokes (which mostly don't work) or be funny and participative, which are actually the worst moments to do so.

In the not-quiet groups, which are full of people with a better sense of [my] humor, I also tell jokes that don't work, but I'm mostly more successful at making people laugh and I feel less ashamed.

P.S. Not official diagnosed yet, but there's an incredibly chance of having ADHD-C, based on a lot of research and relatable experiences here. So, even if I don't have ADHD, I completely relate with you all, people with ADHD-C. :)"

Hey r/ADHD, Im 22 and I finally got my tests reviewed and got diagnosed, but due to either this pandemic or incompetence on the part of my public healthcare provider, the next appointment with any doctor its in 3 months. My psych cannot prescribe specific brands, they just choose the molecule, dose and release time (I got prescribed methylphenidate 36mg extended release, seems far too high for a starting dose), so I might not have many options if whatever I actually receive when my prescription is approved  is not effective for me. On top of that, the psych that diagnosed me today tried to give me amoxetine as the first choice treatment, because ""stimulant medication is only really effective in kids"". Only after telling her that almost 2 years of SSRI use had little to no effect on either my mood or my undiagnosed adhd symptoms made her consider stimulants. She even told me stimulants also take weeks to show effects (!!!). I asked her what to do if I need my dose adjusted, and my only recourse is to try to contact my assigned family doctor, then if they see fit they send a request to my psych, this is less than ideal for many reasons, the biggest of which is that for now all channels to request said family doctor are unresponsive due to the incoming flood of coronavirus cases they will be getting shortly. I would love to say fuck you to my healthcare provider and go to a private doctor, but the cost of lifelong medication is far too high to not take the opportunity to have it subsidized.

Do I take my medication as-is and deal with either under or overdosage, try to get a private psych to carry out the titration, or try to titrate myself (seems like a recipe for disaster)? 

Ah, and the cherry on top is that I get zero psychological support. The ""neuropsychological rehabilitation"" I got prescribed is in limbo until who knows when, so I get to solo the start of medication on top of online classes that already are kicking my ass.

adhd,thecomedygoblin,2020/3/29,"ADHD Book Recommendations I've been thinking a lot about my grade school years, and the books I was interested in back then. I read a lot back then, but I was very particular about what. If a book was assigned to me, I'd have a hard time reading it unless I truly enjoyed it, but I generally sought out books that appealed to me. I'd often start a book or two every week, and drop them after a few chapters, but every once in a while I'd find one that really caught my attention. 

I noticed I was generally interested in science fiction, and thoroughly enjoyed books by Kurt Vonnegut and H.G. Wells, and the Hitchhikers Guide Series was my alternative to the rest off my peers' Harry Potter, but one book in particular stood out to me. 

A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess is possibly the best book recommendation I could make to a highschool student with ADHD. It's a challenging book, using a fictionalized English dialect for most of its narration, however I found deciphering this half-familiar dialect more engaging to me personally. In other books I'd often become frustrated with the unnecessarily complicated language and needless repetition that the authors used to pad out the word count, but in this book I felt like that frustration was intentional, that everyone who read it was experiencing my frustration, so there was more that the author intended us to dissect in learning this language. 

The themes and messages of the book are similarly appealing to ADHD students. Without Spoiling too much,  in ""A Clockwork Orange"" Burgess addresses the futility of forcing everyone to think and develop in the same way, and the dangers of society having a definite notion of how the human mind should work. I truly enjoyed it, and would wholeheartedly recommend it to any other ADHD bookworms out there

For some context, I was diagnosed with ADHD at age seven, but due the to side effects of the first medication I took (concerta, it gave me tics and made me afraid of my dog), my parents were hesitant to put me back on medication until I was 18. I was placed in gifted classes during grade school, but struggled throughout due to my inattentiveness. At 23, I'm proud to say I found my own Psychologist and Vyvanse is working perfectly well for me.

So my Question is this: 

If you could create a High school English curriculum for yourself and a class of other ADHD Students, Which books would be included. Alternatively, Which books would you recommend to readers with ADHD?

There's this one assignment in particular that I've been having a lot of trouble with, and I've been stressing about it so much that I'm starting to neglect doing other assignments even though I'm still not making any progress on it. Often times I get to the point where I've had the right tabs open, but I end up just staring at the screen, trying to figure out what to start with/convince myself to go back to whatever unproductive thing I'd been doing before. Eventually I just get mad at myself for being useless and give up altogether.

This is the same stuff that happened a lot last year, where my teachers were all constantly disappointed in me for never turning things in on time, or never turning them in at all. I thought I was finally starting to get a feel for time managing and work doing when I finished last semester with only a few late assignments, but I'm worried that I'm about to lose all the progress I made because of something that started as a minor slip-up.

I. Qualifications of the Evaluator ¨C The evaluator¡¯s name, title, and
license/certificate credentials must be stated.

II. Current Documentation ¨C Evaluation data must be no more than three years old.

III. Evidence of early impairment - The condition must have been exhibited in childhood in one or more settings. Please include a brief academic history.

IV. Evidence of current impairment - In addition to the individual¡¯s history, documentation of current difficulties must include the student¡¯s clinically significant impairment in current social, academic, or occupational functioning. Must include evidence of impairment in two or more settings. Please include a description of how this individual is functionally limited in the classroom.

V. Historical Information, Diagnostic Interview, Psychological Evaluation
a. Developmental history, including history of symptoms
b. Duration and severity of the disorder
c. Relevant, developmental, historical, and familial data
d. Behavioral Assessment Instruments for ADHD normed on adults; these should
include at least two ratings scales (with scores and summary data) completed by
individuals other than parents (preferably teachers).

VI. Neuropsychological or psychoeducational assessments - Such
assessments are necessary to determine the current impact of the disorder on the
individual¡¯s ability to function in an academic setting. Data should include subtest and
standard scores to support conclusions, and should at least include most recent
versions of a comprehensive intelligence battery and a comprehensive achievement
battery. (Note: Assessments such as checklist and rating scales are very important, but
checklists, scales or subtest scores should not be used as the sole criterion for a
diagnosis of ADHD.)

VII. Diagnosis - A clear and specific statement that the student is diagnosed with ADHD and the accompanying DSM-V code(s) are required. Must include DSM-V criteria upon which this diagnosis was established. Alternative explanations and diagnoses must be ruled out.

VIII. Medication - Indicate whether or not the student is diagnosed while on medication, and whether or not the prescribed treatment produced a positive response. Medication alone cannot be used to support a diagnosis.

IX. Recommendations for Accommodations ¨C The report must include specific recommendations for academic accommodations and the rationale for those accommodations. A history of accommodations does not, in itself, warrant the provision
of similar accommodations.

adhd,seamoreasses429,2020/1/24,"Unusually Effective ADHD/Depression Treatment Combo Hello, so I¡¯ve been a lurker on reddit for a while but finally made my own profile. So I wanted to share some wisdom (particularly with those who have responded sub-optimally to first-line drugs) that I¡¯ve had with an unusual but very effective combo of two medications.

The combination I am taking is Emsam (transdermal selegiline) 6mg per day and Dexedrine 5mg three times per day. This combination is not usually prescribed due to the fact that MAOI¡¯s are normally contraindicated with amphetamines, but this combo was prescribed to me by my psych practitioner and has been profoundly effective for me. 

This combination began to work very quickly for me (improved ADHD/inattention within an hour or two, more overall energy within a few days, decently improved mood within a week, and full relief of dysthymia/depressive symptoms within 3-4 weeks). I have been on this combination for over a year and have had surprisingly few issues with tolerance (my response to amphetamines has actually improved since I started the Emsam patch). 

The only side effects I have noticed with this combination is I am more prone to orthostatic hypotension in the summer heat and I have more trouble with sleep maintenance. I have no trouble falling asleep, but I would wake up after 4-5 hours and be unable to fall back asleep. I was troubled by this for about 4-5 months, and my psych practitioner tried a few drugs (Lunesta 1mg, Trazodone 25-50mg) before we settled on using Robaxin (an old muscle relaxant) 500mg at night off-label as a hypnotic. (For people who have tried medications for stimulant-induced insomnia and found them to cause too much sedation/¡°hangover¡± feeling, I found that Robaxin is much milder, and has helped me fall asleep and stay asleep for 7-8 restful hours of sleep without any morning grogginess).

If you have tried several different drugs and have not found the relief from ADHD or depression, this combination is definitely worth a shot. Feel free to ask me any questions."

I was diagnosed at the age of 5, now I'm 17 and as many of you the symptoms still there, when I was diagnosed it was because then I had a pretty prominent anger management problem and after some appointments the psychologist told my parents (who never told me that I have ADHD and I know only because I was looking at some papers in home), then I had regular appointments with the therapist and some medication, but my mom deliberately decided to stop the medication because she didn't like the side effects that it had on me, fortunately during my entire school life I never had major problems with my grades despite the appointments with the therapist and the medication stopped but of course the...anger problem continued until I was on 6 grade with constant arguing in home and school, in home the problems were more obvious constant careless mistakes caused a lot of family fights, then the fact that I never had a good father figure, my dad never was home, always working and then the divorce, nowadays we barely talk, the closest to father figure I had was my grandpa who died when I was on 7th grade and was the only person that really expend time with me and just didn't throw me home to do nothing, and even if that wasn't enough my mom used to regulate my entertainment to only weekends (and if I didn't had homework), I don't wanna get political since this is not a politics subreddit but I have to explain this for you to understand, I live in Venezuela, a country where mental health is usually forgotten and a lot of people don't even believe that ADHD exist...and also a country under a very severe economical crisis and the beginning of that crisis my mom lost her job (at the same time of the divorce), she always was hysterical but since then her mood has just gotten worse and worse getting very mad and even kind of violent from my careless mistakes, no matter how much I try to explain her that I try my best but some times she just doesn't believe me, this situation has been constantly affecting me since years ago...and no matter how much I do try to fight it all I can't hide the fact that I'm getting tired, since 2 years ago my I started having problems with my mood, things just don't look the same...joy doesn't feel like joy anymore, I tried to just look away from it, just expend time with friends, and then my mom again, she started imposing many restrictions about going out at the point that I just got out for school or for helping her buying things, many times I was forced to stay home even without a valid reason, of course the was a few of times that I got to hang out with friends and if I'm honest I treasure those moments, there was a point I just felt like if I could no more I just didn't even wanted to leave my room, in that moment she finally agreed to take me to the therapist again, but at the end of the appointment the therapist told her that the way that she was treating me was just selfish, I don't even have a proper room for myself and at the time I was sleeping with my grandma, but all of that just made her mad and never took me back there despite the therapist saying that I could even have a another mental illness due to everything, it's very difficult to even talk to her sometimes, she only see things from her point of view and nothing else and if I'm honest almost everyday there's an argue in home, at this point I'm just tired, nowadays I'm in college and my grades just dropped to the floor since the first day, trying to focus is more difficult than before and I just can do nothing even I get to go to another therapist I don't think I can't even afford or find the medication due to the lack of medicines here, and also even if being in home wasn't enough here en Venezuela there's also blackouts almost everyday, the blackouts could last a  few minutes or as long as 12 hours, I'm just tired of all this problems and I don't know if I can't endure more of this pressure for any long now..."

I can't believe I went 13 years without subscribing to /r/ADHD!  After a dangerous hypertensive event I was taken off my ADHD meds but the hypertension has proven resistant to treatment and my life is paralyzed.  I had a mental health crisis and have ID'd  some tools I found incredibly valuable and managed to achieve some measure of growth after identifying a lack of self-compassion.

The recent post [I just want to do nothing for the rest of my life](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/et6er4/i_just_want_to_do_nothing_for_the_rest_of_my_life/) really triggered me, as unmedicated as I am, I can barely generate the will to even ""do nothiing"".  It brings up pain and helplessness that really tests the self-compassion tools some days.

In crisis I reached out to the available resources and started some counselling.  One of the main factors we immediately identified was a complete inability to generate self-compassion.  I think, if our experiences are parallel, that we spend so much time fighting with ourselves and cracking a whip over our own heads the capacity for self-compassion withers and wastes away.

My counsellor started working with me to rebuild that ability using the resources at the [Centre for Clinical Interventions](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/Resources/Looking-After-Yourself), specifically their [Self-Compassion Modules](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/Resources/Looking-After-Yourself/Self-Compassion).

Without spoiling their process, I had a major breakthrough when asked if I would speak to a stranger, adult partner, and finally a child in the manner in which I speak internally to myself.  The answer was no,  I would consider it abuse.   It gave me a moment to acknowledge that, if I wouldn't expect that behaviour to change someone else, why would I expect it to change mine.  I had been so damaging and hurtful to drive myself into the 20%-80% that I can never fully finish that some of my pain, shame, and fear was generated by an abuser.... myself.

Anyway, I'm still off the meds and my life is not in freefall but has been robbed of any motivation and drive whatsoever.  And you know what I'm not pissed off about that anymore,  that little bit of self-compassion I've managed to generate tells me that it wasn't my fault to begin with.

So many young men and women have had their mental health damaged, sometimes permanently, by taking accutane (or isotretinoin), even at a normal dose.

Although there's been a long-standing ""controversy"" about whether accutane actually causes mental health issues, there is irrefutable scientific proof that it does indeed change (sometimes permanently) key functions of the brain in multiple ways.

Keep in mind: the ""proof"" that accutane does NOT cause depression (which is, unfortunately, the current conviction of most dermatologists) is industry-funded, poorly conducted research.

If you developed mental health issues (depression, anxiety, suicidality, psychosis, brain fog/cognitive issues, memory issues, OCD, bipolar, schizophrenia, anhedonia, etc), after taking accutane, there is very good reason to believe that accutane directly damaged your brain.

adhd,rizaladitiyosup,2020/2/8,"A Stanford neurologist¡¯s nine simple tips for quality sleep The serious consequences of sleep deprivation perennially capture society¡¯s attention. And, as kids head back to school, sleep and a lack of it are of particular concern.

&amp;#x200B;

Compared to historical norms, how have our contemporary expectations of sleep changed? What are the effects of inadequate sleep? What can be done to optimize the experience of sleep, especially in the context of insomnia?

&amp;#x200B;

I am a clinician and sleep researcher who treats people with sleep problems. I think there is little reason to suspect that our collective sleep needs have dramatically changed in the recent past, rooted as they are in immutable physiological processes. We should, however, be paying attention to our sleep needs, and that isn¡¯t as hard as it sounds.

What is sleep anyway?

&amp;#x200B;

From a clinical perspective, sleep is defined as a reversible behavioral state of unresponsiveness and perceptual disengagement from the environment. It is dependent on the balance between sleep drive¡ªthe desire for sleep that builds during wakefulness and is linked to the accumulation and clearance of chemicals within the brain like adenosine¡ªand the circadian alerting signal. The circadian rhythm coordinates processes of the body to the environmental patterns of light and darkness. Adequate sleep is and always has been restorative to the body. Giving sleep respect, and preserving it to the benefit of health, has not been so permanent.

&amp;#x200B;

Researchers have learned more about sleep in the past 100 years than in all the preceding millennia combined.

&amp;#x200B;

The advent of, and inexpensive access to, artificial light no doubt marked a significant shift in this history. Scientific understanding of sleep continues to evolve and remains incomplete.

&amp;#x200B;

Nevertheless, it does seem that people are sleeping less now than they have in the past several decades. Recent self-reported national polling among American adults consistently suggests that Americans are not getting adequate sleep. This begs the question: How much sleep do people really need?

Sleep needs change over the lifespan

&amp;#x200B;

Sleep needs change over one¡¯s lifetime. Toddlers may require 11 to 14 hours of sleep to feel rested and typically take naps.

&amp;#x200B;

Through adolescence, the need for sleep diminishes until it approaches the adult average. A typical adult requires from seven to nine hours of sleep nightly to avoid the effects of sleep deprivation. Adults older than 65 years may require just seven to eight hours of sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

Surveys suggest that 35-40% of the adult population sleeps less than seven to eight hours on weekdays. This self-reported sleep data may overestimate the objectively measured sleep obtained by up to one hour, due to time spent falling or getting back to sleep. We are in trouble.

&amp;#x200B;

If someone eats too many calories, or too few, the effects on the body become apparent. Unfortunately, there is no ¡°sleep scale¡± to step onto to gauge the physical tolls of sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation, either from not allotting enough time to get sufficient sleep or due to sleep disorders like insomnia, may have important consequences.

Bad for the brain?

&amp;#x200B;

Beyond sleepiness, sleep deprivation wreaks havoc on the brain, affecting mood and worsening depression, exacerbating pain and undermining executive functions that affect judgment, planning, organization, concentration, memory, and performance. Hormones influencing weight and growth become imbalanced. Immune dysfunction, leading to an increased susceptibility to illness, and a pro-inflammatory state develop.

&amp;#x200B;

Sleep deprivation can become deadly, too. The increased risk of fatal traffic accidents associated with lost sleep parallels that linked to alcohol consumption. Those who sleep fewer than five hours per night have two to three times the risk of a heart attack. Chronic sleep loss may slowly undermine the central pillars of health.

Ditch the digital devices, keep a routine

&amp;#x200B;

How can we avoid the perils of inadequate sleep?

&amp;#x200B;

First, prioritize sleep and ensure that you are obtaining sufficient hours to feel rested. Ensure an easy transition to sleep by maintaining an hour to unwind with relaxing activities before going to bed.

&amp;#x200B;

Reserve the bedroom as a space for sleep: leave electronic devices elsewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep a regular sleep-wake schedule, especially fixing the wake time, including on weekends.

&amp;#x200B;

Get 15 to 30 minutes of sunlight upon awakening, or at sunrise.

&amp;#x200B;

Always go to bed feeling sleepy, even if that means delaying bedtime a little.

&amp;#x200B;

As needed, consider reducing the time in bed if more than 30 minutes is consistently spent awake.

&amp;#x200B;

Be physically active.

&amp;#x200B;

Moderate the use of alcohol and caffeine.

&amp;#x200B;

When sleep problems persist, get help.

&amp;#x200B;

If these do not work, consider evaluation by a board-certified sleep physician. Chronic insomnia may respond well to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. This treatment is increasingly accessible via trained therapists, workshops, online courses and books.

&amp;#x200B;

Symptoms such as frequent or early awakenings, excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, witnessed pauses in breathing, frequent peeing at night, night sweats, teeth grinding, and morning headaches may suggest the presence of sleep apnea. A comprehensive evaluation and appropriate testing may lead to an effective treatment.

&amp;#x200B;

Sleep should come naturally. It should never become an additional source of stress. Simple adjustments can yield benefits quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

Fortunately, the first step to better sleep is recognizing its importance¡ªan objective that has hopefully been achieved. Now, consider making a few changes and, as necessary, access further resources to yield the long-term benefits to health and well-being that only sleep may provide."

I¡¯m not sure whether it¡¯s shock, years of borderline gaslighting which I¡¯ve started to believe myself, or simply that it¡¯s not as much of a big deal as I¡¯d expected it to be, or all of the above, but I still have pretty much all the same feelings of self-blame, apathy and general pessimism for the future.

adhd,relytkad,2020/3/19,"Dextroamphetamine Sulfate IR - Exasperating Chronic Pain hello all,  
I was diagnosed with ADHD (inattentive) ~2 years ago and have been taking prescribed medicine to manage it throughout. I began with d-amph ER and eventually changed to vyvanse which Ive been taking consistently throughout the last year and a half or so.  Doc and I began supplementing the daily vyvanse with daily IR dextroamphetamine sulfate tablets, up to three doses of two tablets a day if desired.

&amp;nbsp;

As I started looking for the preferred dosage ratio, I experienced, what I had previously written off as my having difficulties with diet and health related issues, negative side effects that I hadn't felt before the medicine.  There was also a time when I was taking the combination and did not have said symptoms; I experienced the common negative side effects (e.g. dry mouth, nausea/stomach cramps, loss of appetite, etc.) but began experiencing an extreme fatigue, muscle spasms/cramps, and an increase in joint pain.  I have lived with chronic joint pain/inflammation as well as an extreme pain that radiates from part of my cervical spine of the neck where the is some scoliosis.

&amp;nbsp;

After being bedridden by an episode (a diagnosis of mild iron def. anemia) of this extreme fatigue and intense muscle spasms/pain and recovering after more than a week, I got my next refill of my previously mentioned vyvanse and dextroamph. sulf. prescriptions.  I began taking the combination again (plus two antidepressant meds which I have been taking for a couple of years) and began feeling the debilitating, painful side effects.  I have a had a tendency to research the drugs I am taking and figuring out what side effects are caused or what symptoms I can connect to a specific medication, as I take multiple.  So after this phenomenon, I began seriously looking into to the dextramphetamine sulfate tablets I have been taking, as well as dextroamphetamine and related drugs individually.  Using google to compare symptoms or drug reactions, comes with, of course, lots and lots of horse shit, so there was caution.

&amp;nbsp;

Eventually, I found information on the manufacturer, Aurobindo and anecdotal experiences of those who received d-amph. sulfate manufactured by Aurobindo.  It clicked, and I think there's a good chance that their formulation of the drug is different enough to harm me.  It's unfortunate that I need part of this drug to manage my symptoms, and have no means of receiving the medicine from an alternative manufacturer for the time being; it will require jumping through many systematic hoops which would drive anyone insane, and be particularly difficult with my symptoms to find a pharmacy that has a supply from an alternative source.

&amp;nbsp;

I suppose the point of this post was partially to share my particular thoughts and experience, but also ask for some advice;\
Have others had this experience, either from Auro or another? (Extreme fatigue, bone, joint, muscle pain/spasms/cramps)\
If you have experienced symptoms like these, did you, for whatever reason, continue taking the medicine from Aurobindo, and if you had, how did you manage these painful symptoms?

Hey guys, I¡¯m doing my Research Project topic on how ADHD presents itself differently in different patients and how different medications help dealing with ADHD in different ways/which areas they target more. 

(Skip to end for just the question)

I had been originally diagnosed with adhd at 11 years old however parents decided to hold off on getting any medication because of their bad reputation, however this changed when I began to start failing in high school subjects.

I was re-diagnosed and put onto stattera 40mg for a year or so and noticed an incredible change in behaviour, going from 50 or so ""student incident reports"" in first three years at high school to about 4 for the year.

My problem still however remained, although my impulsiveness, hyper activity and overall destructiveness ceased to exist, I still struggled concentrating/finding patience to complete.

after multiple arguments with my parents I was finally put onto 20mg Ritalin IR, once after school, meaning I was able to complete my homework after school, but still socialise with my friends during school and not just be trapped in my head.

   
 

\- my question is, what medication/treatment are you currently receiving to manage your ADHD and what is its key points/weakness's, for example

40mg - it allowed me to think before I acted, let me control my own behaviour, switched off some of the ""tv static"" in my head, however did not really help with my concentration completing work.

compared to

20mg IR Ritalin - Allows me to complete work, suppresses my behaviour, however suppresses my appetite insanely, completely shuts down my personality, overall hate taking it however can¡¯t complete work without it."

*Brisbane Times (Australia) - Jan 29th, 2020*

A news article highlighting Boon's paper *What do ADHD Neuroimaging Studies Reveal for Teachers, Teacher Educators and Inclusive Education?*

The full journal article is locked behind a pay wall but here's the abstract which provides a general overview:

**Background**
Ongoing  debate  about  Attention  Deficit  Hyperactivity  Disorder (ADHD)  has not resolved ambivalent teacher beliefs about ADHD. This is an important matter since teachers¡¯ beliefs influence their pedagogy, classroom management, and their referral procedures for formal diagnoses of ADHD. They therefore must be provided with up-to-date professional learning about ADHD.

**Objective**
To synthesise neuroimaging studies, which examined differences in brain organisation  and  function  in  those  with  ADHD  compared to  matched unaffected  controls.  The overarching goal was to enhance teachers¡¯ understanding of ADHD by providing synthesised research findings around the neurological basis of ADHD.

**Method**
The PRISMA method was used to search the Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Scopus databases to complete a systematic review of peer-reviewed research that compared individuals with ADHD with matched controls published between 2010 and December 2015.

**Results**
The identification and analyses of 174 MRI and fMRI relevant studies across a sample of over 24,000 showed that there are significant differences in neural anatomy and processing in ADHD compared to unaffected matched controls.

**Conclusions**
Compelling evidence shows ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disability, not a socially determined set of behaviours. Results point to an urgent need for teacher professional learning and systematic up-to-date preservice teacher education along with inclusive education policy reform.

adhd,Cliv2004,2020/2/25,"Rate of Absorption &amp; Duration of Affect Query - Larger Single Dose vs Multiple Smaller Hello All,

Currently nearing the end of my titration on xaggitin xl having settled on 36mg.

My question is this, as I am currently taking two separate 18mg doses to equal the 36mg as it's the easiest way to adjust my dose during titration, will changing to a single 36mg does change the drug absorption rate and thus the duration of affect (DoE)? Potentially making the overall 36mg inadequate?

If anyone knows a study explaining the effects on absorption rate and/or the DoE for the active ingredient, with the amount (in this case 36mg of methylphenidate) and the time of it being administered being controlled/consistent. With the difference being how many physical pills the controlled doses is split into, it would be appreciated if it could be shared.

When a sentence that somebody says turns in to two or three sentences the first has already entered the mind to be stored in order to focus on the later points, all equally important. When (what I believe) a normal individual processes this information they are able to formulate a response with ease. Somebody who suffers from ADHD especially untreated searches their mind for the first point that was made and the response that came with it, only to see a word or two as it whips around this tornado. As the panic begins to set in to the mind of this ADHD individual the tornado increases and begins engulfing more of what is important to them.

I have managed to complete a couple on my own time, mainly because I brute forced my way through it and made it my goal to actually finish something for one, even if it's just a rough draft.

There's a saying that the best writers are also avid readers, and that if you are a writer, you should love reading. I don't dislike reading per se, but I find it difficult to stay focused with traditional novels and hate that I can rarely finish them unless it something that I think is really good.

Do any of y'all know some strategies I could apply in order to stick with a book all the way through, or any tips about writing?

I'm starting to think I should be writing in a different medium, but they don't seem as accessible unless you already have some experience (being in the film industry in order to write screenplays), or there doesn't seem to be much of a market (novellas and short stories, at least compared to novels). I recall reading somewhere that George R. R. Martin took up novel writing because he wasn't restrained by a budget.

TL;DR I want to write and publish my fiction, but I don't read a lot of novels."

adhd,ronald0n9,2020/4/2,"My journey so far dealing with ADD/Bi-polar disorder  This is my second post to Reddit and I'm not usually much of a writer/blogger etc, so bare with me!

I'm an 29 year old male adult who was diagnosed with ADD late in life at the age of 25 years. For the last 4 years I've primarily taken Ritalin (30mg p/day) which has been an absolute game changer.

For most of my life however, I've struggled with identify and self worth issues, the negative affects of having un-diagnosed ADD, but also regular mood shifts from feeling grounded, level headed, socially likable and intelligent to aggressive, angry, rude, socially unlikable and conflict orientated all in a matter of seconds.

I first started taking anti-depressants and seeing a psychologist when I was about 20 years told to treat my panic attacks, anxiety, mood and self worth/identity issues.

I've seen three difference Psychologists with my current one who I have been seeing for about 3 months working out reasonably well, although I put up pretty high walls so we have made some ground but I am resistant to letting people get too close, baby steps and all that.

I tried a bunch of meds including venlafaxine (Effexor). fluoxetine (Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft). For me, these med did fuck all and in fact (again just my own experience and each person is obviously very different!). After swapping in and out new anti-depressants for about 3 years to try and find the right one for me, I finally gave up and decided to just get on with life and deal with these feelings in the best way I knew how, drinking, taking pills, porn, cocaine, smoking bongs, and any kind thing I could get my hands onto to give myself a quick fix of dopamine, or feeling of happiness (I have a very additive personality and even when I'm mentally stable I still find myself seeking out these things at unnecessary times.

I start my journey today on meds which hope to improve my mood disorder. I met with my new Psychiatrist yesterday and along with continuing my Ritalin medication, he has now prescribed me with Lithium (450mg p/day for the first week then, 900mg p/day there after) and Agomelatine (50mg p/day) for mild bi-polar disorder.

It would be great to talk to people with similar experience to myself, particularly with ADD/Bi-polar or anyone that cant relate to what I am saying in any, shape or form.

Take care,

adhd,quesorah,2020/1/13,"How do I explain ADHD and symptoms to boyfriend while wrestling ADHD-related shame and self-hatred? I¡¯ve been diagnosed with ADHD since I was 11 and actively managing it since 17. I definitely have ADHD and the majority of symptoms associated with it, in addition to the deep shame and self-hatred that many of us feel regarding the effects of our symptoms. I¡¯ve never particularly felt the need to fully explain my ADHD and accompanying symptoms to another person, there¡¯s never been a need (maybe something to do with that fun correlation of more short-term friendships than long-term we seem to notice every so often), but I do now.

I¡¯ve been in a relationship for about a year and a half with a very analytic, quantitative, problem-solving guy who has been so so so good with me and my depression and anxiety. He¡¯s patient and understanding, he¡¯s an incredible listener and strives to be as supportive as he can even when all I can do is sit silently with him. He knows I have ADHD, just not the full scope of what ADHD is and the accompanying symptoms. He¡¯s already extremely supportive of me when I¡¯m exhibiting symptoms, he just doesn¡¯t know that it¡¯s my ADHD yet.

Perhaps these disorders - anxiety and depression - are far easier to explain, or more accurately understood by the general public, but whenever I have attempted to describe the effect of ADHD on my day-to-day life I feel like I¡¯m making excuses, lying, or conveniently pulling symptoms from a questionable mommy blog.

I think this could stem from the shame and self-hatred, maybe no one else thinks it sounds fake but the tiny mean voice in my head consistently calls me a liar, a con artist, a drama queen, a general scummy character.

I guess my question is two-fold: do you have any tips for explaining ADHD and its symptoms to someone unfamiliar with them? Do you have any advice for battling the self-hatred long enough to make it through an explanation of ADHD?

tldr: My ADHD instills a sense of shame in me and convinces me that ADHD is fake, how do I explain my ADHD to my boyfriend while dealing with this?"
adhd,PeachKnight96,2020/1/6,"Looking for infor regarding amphetamine based drugs long term effects and effects on ED Hey,

After having ED problems due to taking Ritalin and Concerta, my doctor wants to prescribe me amphetamines, particularly ""Attent"" (Adderall counterpart).

I read about the mechanism of this drug and it sound a lot more risky than drugs like Concerat because it promotes the release of dopamine as opposed to inhibiting the re-uptake of it.

What I basically would like to know is : does anyone here ever experienced ED problems while on Adderall/amphetamines, what are the long term effects you feel on it?

I am asking these questions here because there are no side-effect warnings about ED on either type of drug (even though I only experience them while under the effect of the drug, really healthy besides that) and I haven't find any long term effect studies, particularly talking about this.

Also practitioners in my country have no idea about Amphetamines, it is not covered by any insurance here and I have to order it especially.

I miss the fine details and nonverbal cues which, unfortunately, contain a lot of important information. Add anxiety to the mix and you can imagine how awkward my conversations are with new people.

adhd,Bigpops76,2020/2/17,"Does Concerta become more effective with sustained use? I was recently diagnosed with ADHD with inattentive presentation. The doctors prescribed 18mg Concerta and said that I'll have to check back with them to see about adjusting the dose. While I do feel it helps a bit, it hasn't given the level of clarity and focus as described by other posts on this subreddit. It also only seems to be active for around four hours. From my understanding, methylphenidate drugs like Concerta inhibit the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, providing more stimulation for receptors thus treating ADHD symptoms. I know many antidepressants work similarly, except with neurotransmitters associated with depression. Antidepressants aren't effective immediately but begin treating symptoms with sustained use. I've heard this is the same with methyphenidate, but I can't find much information about it. Does this prove to be true in any of your experiences with methyphenidate medication?"

adhd,verytinybears,2020/1/12,"I cleaned my apartment for the first time, and it¡¯s still clean! Last week I cleaned my entire apartment for the first time since I moved in, which was in August. I know five months is a lot; this was partially due to the fact that it took me a while to get furniture, which I knew would require slightly more assembly and power tools than a MALM bed from IKEA (which creates a mess), and partially due to the fact that my severe ADD combined with my ever-worsening depression has become an increasingly difficult burden to shoulder over the years, but I digress. 

So I cleaned everything, vacuumed the dog hair off of every surface in and out of sight, put all the dirty laundry in the hamper, hung up everything that was clean, organised everything to the best of my ability using what minimal storage space I currently have, and when I was finally finished I sat down on my newly dog hair free couch and just felt... defeated. I looked around at my beautiful, spacious apartment that my wonderful dog and I have all to ourselves and all I could think was that it was a waste of time to clean it, that it¡¯ll just be a mess again tomorrow, because I¡¯m a mess and so is everything around me. I went to sleep upset and angry with myself. 

Lo and behold, one day passed, then two, then three, and now a whole week, and my whole apartment still looks just as neat as the day I cleaned it!

I love that I have ADHD, but I've found that if I'm not careful, I find myself investing hours into planning to curate a new skill or hobby that I never considered before instead of actually doing what I need to do. This gets more dangerous if I start thinking about it whilst on my meds!! 

One night I ended up spending hours reading about domain flipping, and the next thing I knew it was 2am and hadn't done a single thing on my to-do list. 

Other times I've made Amazon wishlists of musical instruments I'd like to learn, and researched local music teachers and their prices....

Recently I found myself searching screenwriting courses and thinking about whether I could do that alongside my current science degree.

Another thing I've done is spend a whole year working on an embroidered portrait of a cat because I decided to try it on a whim, then kept getting bored and leaving it for a few months until I remembered it again.

adhd,dowrybrides,2020/2/8,"Question about switching medications/lowering dosage of adderall Hi all,

Perhaps like many of you, I regularly take adderall to help manage some of my ADHD symptoms (I'm ADHD-PI), and it has worked wonders in terms of reducing my inattentiveness and boosting my focus. I recently graduated from college and am working a part-time job as a tutor. The job itself isn't very demanding, and from my experimentation thus far have determined that I am as effective at tutoring without meds as I am while on my adderall. I'm currently planning on taking a year off from school, saving money, and studying to the point where I'll perform well on either my GRE/LSAT (not sure which one yet) and then enroll in a school of my choosing next spring. 

My question is this: would it make sense for me to switch to a non-stimulant medication while studying for an important standardized test (GRE or LSAT), while also working a non-stressful job? I've researched strattera quite a bit, and while I have my reservations about it am inclined to ask my psychiatrist about trying it out, but I've also strongly considered just asking my psychiatrist to lower the dosage of my current adderall prescription. My main worry is finding the right balance between focus and relaxation, so that I am attentive enough to my studies to gain admission to graduate school, but also not to the point where I exhaust myself from an excessive intake of stimulants. 

Thanks for reading! 

TL;DR: Studying for GRE/LSAT this year, should I stick with adderall and lower my dosage or switch to a non-stimulant (e.g strattera) and see whether it works for me or not?"

I was diagnosed with depression and bad anxiety disorder, and I'm dealing with it for the past 7 years. I'm taking my medication regularly as well as talking with my psychiatrist and that combined has help me feel way better, but this problem still remains.  


&amp;#x200B;

Whether it's anime, any kind of game, drawing, writing or reading, I'm really into it ranging from a few hours a day to a few weeks, but in the end I lose all interest for the certain activity and I get bored of it. Once I lose interest, it doesn't come back for months, even years in some situations, and if by some miracle it comes back it lasts for quite a short time then the same story all over again. If I want to finish something I have to force myself to do it, otherwise it is out of the question. I also can't focus properly even if I'm doing something, my mind keeps wandering around and it's like my body automatically grabs my phone or anything near me after few minutes to entertain myself, and it's hard to be focused on something for longer than 10 minutes. For example; if I'm watching a youtube video, I cannot be still and watch it in one sitting no matter how long it is, I automatically open new tab, start searching for a new video, I start to fiddle with pens on my desk etc. I don't know whether it's worth mentioning, but the only remaining thing that I'm really interested in and makes me happy is skincare, and it has been that way for the past 2 years.

So here's my plan on enjoying my last moments, wish you all can succeed in your suicide too.

The first 3 days I will be climbing up the mountains by car, and finding a peaceful place that no one will find on foot, and enjoying the beautiful scenery along the road as it will be my last travel.

I am not going to eat anything during the last 3 days, cause I will have to consume my calories first before going to enjoy a peaceful hibernation, so I will bring food with low calories and alot of water to fill my stomach.

The plan for the last 2 days of my life is finally arriving at the mountain peak and finding the right place to end everything on foot and since there won't be a place for me to stay overnight, I will not sleep during the third night. instead, I'm going to watch my favorite animes of all time(already saved them in my laptop, lasts 1d and 13hr in total).

Finally it will come the fourth night, I will take off all my clothes and experience slowly while looking at the most important person in my life, my anime waifu, who is also the reason I could go through the past 3 yrs, she's hair is also white just like the snow, so I'm thinking it will perfectly fit the scene, and hopefully at the last minutes of my life I can get to have some great near death experiences as my brain starts to produce some dopamine to make sure I've lived a great life, and I'm hoping that my waifu could appear there in my brain and say some words to me.

Also if I find out that I'm not dead yet on the fifth day, I can only use my backup plan, which is hanging my self with a noose, but that will be a very normal and bad end to me, so guys please wish me luck on getting a peaceful and joyful death, thanks."

I just want this to end any way possible, I don't even care anymore, and none of my friends or family would miss me or even notice at this point, much less care to help.

The only people who helped me I can't see because of this whole Corona thing, which stresses me out even more, because I don't want to see the people I care about get hurt, even if they don't care if I do.

They always tell me it will get better but life only gets harder from here, and if I can't take the tiny bit of stress from my life then there is no hope for my future."

suicidewatch,confessions_of_,2020/4/6,"If you developed suicidality as a result of taking Accutane (isotretinoin), there's new subreddit group for you. Introducing: r/AccutaneDamage. Discuss delayed post-exposure toxicity and stories. The damage to your mental and physical health can occur after you stop the drug. So many young men and women have had their mental health damaged, sometimes permanently, by taking accutane (or isotretinoin), even at a normal dose.

Although there's been a long-standing ""controversy"" about whether accutane actually causes mental health issues, there is irrefutable scientific proof that it does indeed change (sometimes permanently) key functions of the brain in multiple ways.

Keep in mind: the ""proof"" that accutane does NOT cause depression (which is, unfortunately, the current conviction of most dermatologists) is industry-funded, poorly conducted research.

If you developed mental health issues (depression, anxiety, suicidality, psychosis, brain fog/cognitive issues, memory issues, OCD, bipolar, schizophrenia, anhedonia, etc), after taking accutane, there is very good reason to believe that accutane directly damaged your brain.

So: Introducing: [r/AccutaneDamage](https://www.reddit.com/r/AccutaneDamage/).

Time after, I got diagnosed with an AVM and it's inoperable, I know my parents are worried, and little time later I got diagnosed with an arrhythmia, so I know that my parents are troubled for that.

After that, I continued my studies and got accepted into medicine, but even so, I thought my parents would be glad, but instead, they got more frequently angry at me, I just don't want to cause problems

My parents are good people, they gave me everything I needed and wanted, I was a spoiled child, I did everything I can, just to give them happiness, they raised me well, but even so, they get angry at me just for stupid reasons, (no physical abuse), but sometimes the words are worse than a wound, and if they're angry at me, and for no reasons, then the best solution for their problems is to kill myself, I don't want to be a problem anymore, so there's not a reason to continue living.

I never really liked anything, my personality was false, my life is false, everything I did was for others, I'm not a human, I don't have anything that would make me one."

suicidewatch,The_Space_Fox,2020/3/10,"Everytime i take the train i think about killing myself. Hi, I'm a 15y/o student, not a native speaker and using Google Translator, so maybe this text can be confusing.


Going straight to the point, I think about killing myself since 2018, that year my grandfather discovered he had an incurable genetic disease, something I never imagined, my parents are separated, so he was like a father to me, besides he being the  person with whom I spent the most of my time, continuing, after he discovered this disease he spent the whole year in hospital, when he was discharged he returned to my house, but he only spent about three days until he returned to the hospital, with the disease progressing he started to lose weight to the point of weighing almost twice as little as I, who am already thin, in addition to the progress of the disease he developed depression, normally I often visited him, but from time to time he didn't have enough energy even to  greet me. 

On November 11 he had an internal hemorrhage, that same day I went to visit him, my mother did not warn me of anything, when I arrived he was bleeding a lot, but he did not know, he was very happy because of  strong antidepressants that he was taking, but he felt pain, even after taking morphine, seeing someone I loved very much dying in front of me and being unable to do anything was the worst thing that had ever happened to me, he died on 13  November at 6:50 am.


That same year I started having suicidal thoughts, I spent most of the time alone, since my mom and grandma were always in the hospital, my mom was much stressed and often told me that I was just born to disturb her, that i was no good for anything and things like that, over time I started to isolate myself at school and become an introvert, I talked almost every day with CVV (Similar to National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in my country) because I felt very lonely, but no matter how much time passed, suicidal toughts only increased. That same year I took the exam to enter a school that is considered the best in my state believing that i would be better. 

In 2019 I went to the school that I took the exam, but due to my introvert even with a month of classes I still didn't have any friends, I ate lunch alone and came home alone, in that period I almost tried to commit suicide, but luckily I managed to make some friends. On the other hand, the school's teaching is horrible, and I can't learn almost anything, I usually got good grades, but at this school I get horrible math grades, which makes me feel like a crap, in addition to the school being very tiring in general.

That same year I started to like someone, the second time it occurred to me, but the person I liked already liked someone, the problem is that I started to compare myself with the crush of the person that I liked, which decreases even more my self-esteem, over time I started to compare myself with anyone, always coming to the conclusion that I suck, only increasing my suicidal toughts.  I talked to my mother about my suicidal thoughts, she said that I would start going to the psychologist earlier this year, but until now she apparently forgot, which shows how important I am to her. 

I don't have a hobby, I can't like almost anything i do, I hate waking up early to go to a place that suck, my self-esteem is only getting worse, I can't take pictures of myself for 2 years because every time that I see myself I realize how ugly I am, I have no more plans, I hate myself so much, I hate my appearance, voice, personality, everything that i'm, if I kill myself I will not be missed by anyone, I am replaceable in all areas of my life, my friends only talk to me because I often do jokes and my mom just pretends to care about me because she doesn't want the money she spent on me to be in vain. 

No matter how long I wait, things just get worse and worse. It's been three days since I have slept 4 hours because I am very anxious, I just want to end the bad joke that is my life, nothing is going to change, nothing is going to get better, I have no reason to continue supporting it every day. 

Every day I take the subway to go to my school, and every day I think that jumping there would not be a bad idea, I don't know what to do, I think it will just happen, anyway that don't makes a difference to anyone..."

A person who is suicidal is already dealing with a lot of pain that is eating his soul alive, not giving the possibility to commit suicide doesn¡¯t prevent the person from committing suicide, it makes make his inner suffering longer, eventually pushing the subject to hurt himself to commit suicide and have a painful death as terrible as his existence. Recognizing the importance of our death quality would allow the subject to die more peacefully and enjoy his death. If we do not give people the possibility to choose if they want to live this life or not we will push the subject to commit extreme acts, for instance jumping out of the train, affecting other people¡¯s life and creating unnecessary trauma. Legalizing suicide would give people a sense of serenity and a way out to their mental suffering. We can not understand what we didn¡¯t experience, if the subject is going through unbearable existential suffering for whatever reason, he has to have the option to die in peace. You can not understand how a person affected by schizophrenia or whatever he has feels like. We do have to accept death as part of life and be fine with it. Nobody has the right to make somebody live against his own will, life is not meant to be a mental rape.

another dream collapsed,
another spell is cast,
but this desert, it seems so vast.
A life spent in the search of meaning,
might turn out to be an empty book,
whose pages aren't worth turning.
From beginning until the end,
in all my searching, I could find,
that every desire I cooked up in my mind,
and every wish that filled my eyes with fire,
were just a string of bad decisions, 
that has painted my inescapable past,
and every emotion that I've come across,
ran away from me so incredibly fast,
and the only one that turned up in the end,
is this overbearing stillness, that has occupied my mind.
But now.
The time has come, 
for me to overcome,
this struggle, that is life,
and put an end to my internal strife.
From beginning until the end,
I've realized all my searching was just to find,
the perfect last words,
to justify, me bidding adieu to this world."

It's become even worse since my stepmom came back, because now my dad just lets her scream and yell at us because ""she only means well"", he mindlessly agrees with her whenever she says my problems don't matter.

It's not really about me instead more about Nikol, but i would appreciate everyone's advice and support! 

(also i'm not sure if this is the right community and honestly really don't know where to start the story, because it's way too bizarre to understand or believe it, but i'll try anyway) 

Nikol was born with cancer, is allergic to the sun, has bad luck in life and is innocent since always, because her parents have never loved or cared about her, all they ever did was abuse mentally + physically and talk bad for no reason, her father is actually not really her father, because she had a blood test and the result was that her mother was with her ""uncle"", her younger brother stole her Nintendo Switch and never gave it back, she never got money support from her parents that she needed for school / university + not even lunch, the whole ""family"" are bunch of irresponsible rude people, the only good thing that Nikol had in life was her dear late Grandmother who took care of and raised her to be an honest, good and heartwarming person. 

I always liked Nikol, because she is a wonderful, interesting, smart, etc. person and did everything I could to help so that she has a better life that she deserves like to help her mentally, gift her a good bed so that she no longer has back pain, laptop so that she has it for university, cell phone so that she does not become alone and can talk with me, switch so that she has fun, a rabbit that gives her joy, etc. etc. etc. I know it would sound like a scam at first sight, but for me it's not, because no one really got to know her that well, but i really know and talk to her almost everyday and that it's not a waste so i'm the one who helped out and bought all the stuff that she needed in life and that i really don't care about money or that she never would dare to ask me about doing all that in the first place, but it showed how grateful Nikol really is with tears of joy, because of my kindness. I also took good care (for a short time) of her late Grandmother, paid for a proper grave and promised her before that that i will take care of and protect Nikol so that she doesn't have to worry anymore which made her happy and feel at ease until the end. 

Nikol should be happy and if she dies, then everything was for nothing and I really love her and want her to live so I only believe that I can help her and that she needs me, but now I just don't know where to start, Nikol was really (/always) depressed (because her life was already bad enough thanks to her family) + suicidal since the accident which was 2 months until the trauma amnesia started, now she can't recognize me anymore and it's really hard for me to accept the truth, so i would really appreciate everyone's help!

I basically lost contact with friends (I can contact them online but I am certain that they would be at this point tired of my shenanigans) because I lost my ability to ever be enrolled in a normal high school due to them being tired of my suicidal tendencies thus leaving us with a home school program based in the US as the only option (I am from the Philippines by the way).

Now looking at what is happening like my interests getting ruined by the politics and opinions of people who claim to end discrimination and the existence of those who do discriminate, I feel like I am unwelcome in this world.

suicidewatch,dontaskme_that,2020/3/8,"am i wrong for wanting to end it?   

I for so long want it to end it all

I am 34 years old and have accomplished nothing, don¡¯t own a house, don¡¯t have money, first I am in a job that I am overqualified for and my superiors to cover and excuse not promotion me point out every little miss steps and project that not finished due to not fault of my own but rather bad decision making from higher up.

Second, I opened business for my own, put all money in it, stupid I know, and now I lost it all.

Broke and in a lot of debt I don¡¯t even know how to start paying it back, bank made a case against me and now I am forbidden form travel, any government services like driving license renewal and bank services \[this a punishment for people that can¡¯t pay back debt in my country\].

In short financially I am screwed, no money or hope in saving any in near future.

And for my family, I am married with two daughters that I would die for but always stressed over how to give them descent life and for my wife I tried to do everything for her but because it was arranged marriage we have nothing in common, not our view of life or opinions in anything, not even our taste in music, movies, television nothing not even on how we manage our house, asked for the extra thing when I couldn¡¯t provide the requirement and the culture here that women should not spend her errand money in the house because it is the man job she didn¡¯t but a single dollar in the house even after she had a job, If I ask her to spend money its will be as a loan after she would insult me mentioning her sisters husbands and how the don¡¯t need help spending on the family .

And the last nail in coffin, she cheated, I was destroyed, after butting up with everything working 14 hours a day to have her and children not felling the crisis I am through and maintain their lifestyle, after pairing with the insults and the horrible treatment.

All my life I failed in everything, can¡¯t remember one descent thing I did right, always stressed and always tired I have no welling to live anymore, nothing to look forward to, no signs that things will be better, also I am diabetic, why should I live like this, for what or for whom I should endure this life?"
suicidewatch,userac023,2020/2/14,"severe depression, anger, unable to ""cope"" anymore / lack of coping skills, looking to use prescribed psychiatric medication to eventually commit suicide or do crazy things i've sought mental health treatment since age 18, now i am almost 27, and progressively my mental health and well being has declined more and more. at first, i was just diagnosed with anxiety and depression at around age 18 or so which i knew that my problems were much more than just depression and anxiety, and around age 21 or so, i was diagnosed then with schizotypal personality disorder and major depression.

long story short, i've been basically surviving all these years, not ""coping"". whenever i tried putting myself out there and do ""therapeutically"" things, all this did to me was cause more trauma and anger, not relating to other people, and made me even more paralyzed up till now. from countless mental health groups in person for years, online forums, trying different antidepressants (ssri's), other medications, etc. despite all these mental health sources saying that those who put themselves out there and do all these things, and consistently have social interactions, etc, are more likely to be in better shape, etc, but for me, i wish i never did any of this, because all it did was cause more wounds and trauma, though at home, it's not much different with my brother who had abused me and traumitized me and then my narcissistic father who i have to regularly deal with. 

so much, that despite wanting to die everyday and w.e, and seeing that there may be medications ( psychiatric specifically ) that could possibly give me hope, the very thought of someone saying, medications are only part of the solution, yet, that's my issue. that's the only reason or hope i'd have is to force myself to take them in doing exactly the same to which i do with my compulsive coping mechanisms just so i can survive, only that, the psychiatric medications would be ""correct"", but i don't need to change what i do elsewhere, i am who i am...

one of the things that contributes to the extreme anger i have is despite all the effort i put and putting myself out there, doing things, etc, i'd never get anyone who could come through and was actually similar to me in terms of how they functioned, etc. 95 percent or more of the people i'd see in mental health groups either took medication and / or did not have a personality disorder. the only ones that did have a PD weren't people i related to, ( they were all borderline PD people and i am disgusted by them ). 

there are articles and sources saying how natural ways of coping and methods are better than medication and should be utilized when possible, however, my point of course here is that these are NOT AN OPTION! i don't have any of these natural coping mechanisms whatsoever, even when i'm doing them right in front of other people and them praising me for it, i don't feel one bit good doing them, but quite the opposite, it just makes me more unstable!!! so in other words, what i'm trying to say is this anger ongoing and what has been produced into me is well relative to psychosocial / upbringing, combined with brain chemistry abnormality / personality issue. 

the problem is, if  i do go onto medication, i know that circumstances, etc, factors will not change, however, one reason, i'd take the medication is because somehow it will give me a way to commit suicide easier, being that, either way, my personality and way of being, circumstances, etc, are out of my hand, but at least with medication, it might somehow give me some capacity to build up and eventually kill myself or not be scared to emote naturally to other people ( externalize myself irrationally to others, and either harm them physically or verbally insult them without worrying about being scared, instead of controlling myself for safety reasons, because i'd be safe with the medication, or at least i hope the medication would prevent me from becoming fully psychotic or end up in a mental hospital ). for example, i'd take it for a year without particular change in my life, more or less same circumstances, and even if they are different, i'd still have to be on the medication or else i'd just end up in the same doom, however, doing so will cause even greater side effects and withdrawal, so i'm bound to take the medication for the rest of my life forcefully....

i guess my point is that my issue is that no one will help with keeping me safe with the medication protocol, so i dont end up with deadly withdrawal. however, on the other end, as long as i'm ON the medication and it seem to be keep me going, then i can use it to my advantage and have special powers from it and do something crazy, which i wouldn't have the capacity to do without the medication. it give me a good reason to exist. sort of like injecting illegal drugs into yourself, only legal but to give you the same effect, make you crazy and go ruin other people's lives. SSRIs of course are not the answer as they severely make me ill and withdrawal effects certainly wouldn't allow me to commit suicide, so if i do take some kind of antidepressant, im not sure which one i could find that can numb me out while giving me extra capacity and superpowers so i can eventually commit suicide, but it can't cause serotonin syndrome for one."

It would have allowed my family to avoid the stigma that comes with suicide, allowed me to finally end my pain and no individual would face any blame.  It seems like such a clean and acceptable way to go out.  &lt;br&gt;
I feel terrible for the family members of those that were in Kobe's helicopter because they didn't ask for or deserve this tragic loss.  But as someone suffering from suicidal ideation myself, it would have been a perfect situation for me to have been in - quick, relatively painless, tragically unanticipated, no one's fault, etc.  I fantasize about this often and can't stop thinking about how what happened to Kobe would have been perfect for me.  &lt;br&gt;
Unlike catching some sort of disease like cancer or virus (which would take a long time and leave my family financially drained from medical bills) or being murdered (which would feel unjust and unresolved) or even committing suicide (which would bring long-lasting stigma, unanswered questions and endless second-guessing) dying by a tragic accident seems like it would accomplish everything I am looking for. &lt;br&gt;

Due to posting for University, I have had to make a new Reddit account (hence my low karma), but I am looking to gain participants to complete my dissertation survey for my final year of University.

I am a Psychology student and the dissertation is on the effect sleep disturbances on mental health (including anxiety, depression and suicidal behaviours).

There is a mass of evidence showing how taking part in studies on mental health is beneficial for those who are suffering (Gibson, Boden, Benson, &amp; Brand, 2014, Wong, Kwok, Michel, &amp; Wong, 2017), it has also been seen to greatly reduce suicidal ideation.  I feel as those us on this subreddit will be able to give a good insight into this necessary research, please if you can, take part.

I would love for anyone to take part, and hopefully you will all feel a benefit from getting in touch with areas of your mental health. If not, there are many help links on the information sheet for many areas of the world, so please feel free to use them.

suicidewatch,summarizedissue,2020/4/10,"The Alteration of Reality is Now a Requirement for Happiness Caring about the corollary of my soon-to-be actions and how they might affect my relatives was initially the only thing detouring me from suicide. Because of recent events, the reality in which I gave any sort of puissance to that outlook has now dwindled significantly, and, as a result of that, I am now earnestly considering the ""easy way out.""        


For most of my life, my teachers, friends, relatives, and acquaintances have all commented on how intelligent I am; however, I do not appreciate these comments as they, in turn, cause me to reflect on the enigmaticness of my life; more specifically, my education. Education that differentiates from tradition is a viable option; this is especially the case now. But my schooling was not what most people, generally speaking, would consider decent. I had nil motivation for any of the work and my mother, of whom now has the ideology that a majority of my issues at that time of relevancy were a result of my idiocy, and she is no longer interested in providing auxiliary to my psychological disorders. I do not feel as if she is obligated to do so either. Because of this, I have not reached my self-situated potential.  


Yes, once you've reached the acme of adolescence, you cannot necessarily give ponderance to adult intervention. However, I was a nine-year-old at the start of my mental deterioration. Nothing was done that dealt with my problems at the time; nothing is being done now. I am 16. I am capable of teaching myself many things; I have done so before; however, I am not longer motivated. Every single hour alive is agonizing. I have requested in the past that I should possibly see medical help, but it is unlikely that I will ever receive any medication because of my mother's doctrines surrounding medicine. It similarly doesn't help that I am unable to connect with nearly everyone I know.  


I have been told by many that I will achieve feats that are only topical in the dreams of others. These comments are egregious, and most of them come from the same ideologues who believe that I will attain prosperity (I do not want prosperity) without assistance; that is how they justify their lack of germaneness in my life.   


I am unable to go to my therapist because of COVID-19, which has been very detrimental to my mental wellness; I am aware that there are other methods of contacting mental-health professionals, yet I do not wish to communicate with someone who is salaried to disperse help without much ponderance as to how the said help could affect the person they're talking to. Similarly, they are not bound by many legal ties.  


Regardless of the rightfulness of my claim, I feel as if no one has ever cared about me, especially concerning my clinically-diagnosed disorders (e.g., everyone tends to brush them off as nothing, they are continually degraded by means of equalizing one's idiosyncrasies with that of mine, etc.), and throughout my entire life, I have had to incline my issues without parental or familial support, resulting in the suppression of my emotions.  


My brain is still malleable enough to transmogrify into someone more acquit for life, but I doubt I will see that through as a corollary of my present situation. I am not nihilistic, I believe that there are intrinsic, self-provided reasons to continue living, but I do not wish to put the effort into a world that I do not want to be in, and that is my downfall. To reiterate: I am capable of changing, but why should I change if the reality I am putting effort into is not at all comparable to the internal reality I have meticulously invented for myself.  


(I will not provide an estimated time until I attempt anything, as not only does that emit a sense of hopelessness for apparent reasons, but it would also inadvertently force me to follow through with my threats. I will also respond to any comments that desire elaboration.)"

suicidewatch,AntiWhatevertf,2020/4/4,"Writing to Relax I happen to write things down every once in a while, part diary, part fiction, often in order to relax when I am very tense.

So I decided to post one of these a this one comes off as better than usual to me:

""As much as the sense of self-worth, dictated by nature, entails a will to exist, the actualization of worthlessness, a state of being an object, a pile of flesh without actual reason, entails an immediate yearning for destruction, for the structure to break apart. This is a core of the concept of self harm, not necessarily a dysfunctional anger turned towards one's self out of desperation but a pause in the constant process of only one element of nature's near ceaseless control, that is mouth-fed self-worth.""

And yes, I wrote this right after I gave myself a big bump on the head but I ran cold water over it and it is already getting better."

I considered a letter, but even at the best of times that would probably take at least two days. I don't see any options in regular texting that would send a text a few hours later, and I'd be worried about it not working. Sending a text or email directly before the act is out of the question, as anyone to whom I'd send such a message knows where I live and could possibly have the police there before I am finished."

suicidewatch,thisispsychomachia,2020/2/11,"Has anyone else here spent alot of time helping others through life issues with emotional support and advice, and genuinely love helping people, only for everyone you've known to just bolt when you're the one suffering? All my life I've wanted to be in the mental health field, and get through to those suffering, even if just a little. Psychology is my passion and primary interest, and I've always felt so extremely good helping anyone in any way possible. Now that I'm the one whose life has come crashing down in every sense, at a dead end with no hope, there is literally nobody who doesn't run away whenever I express my own pain, isn't that fucked up? The people that I've helped or tried to, they have their lives on track now, and I suppose they don't want to be dragged down by negativity? For the record, I don't normally vent to anyone, because I've learned my lesson. As a 23 year old guy with no health insurance, support systems, and my only family being people consumed by substance abuse issues and prone to cold narcissism, as well as friends that find getting deep uncomfortable unless they're the ones in trouble,  I've come to believe subconsciously, that talking about my issues is essentially whining and embarrassing myself. I try to ignore my issues and just keep busy and work and drink myself to sleep or go to parties and try to indulge in simple pleasures as much as I can before I can't afford to anymore, just passing time until I've learned enough to help myself improve the core issues that consume me. 

Again, for the record, I understand people's feelings very easily and as such I can't blame anyone for alienating themselves from me, I can put myself in anyone's shoes, and it's ok. I also understand my own deep issues very well and although I know how I could start to improve upon them, it would be monumentally difficult, and I'm not even sure I want to anymore. Though I understand myself and others better now, from the ages of 5 to 17, i was forced to take loads of drugs that very drastically changed my cognitive processes to the point where I was in a deep fog for all of those years, as for my family, that seemed easier than talking to me, at all, about anything, or teaching me anything. Hey doctors, he's broken, fix him, no we can't offer emotional support and our premiums dont cover therapy, so give him drugs.

Now that I've discarded simple fixes like those drugs, ever since I have understood myself and others so much more, and though it's easier to understand and help others, and I feel more like myself, without the fog and being a zombie all the time, without the numbness and forgetfulness and apathy, I've realized that there is literally nothing else that had or will be helping me, and the simple fix or drugs, was the only thing there for me. Though it dumbed me down, disconnected me from my own inner harmony, clouded my memory and general effectiveness, they made me forget, about pain in general. So I guess it was a mistake to just take up binge drinking every night as soon as I turned 21, but I mean that's helped too. I feel like shit every morning and barely eat or exercise, but I make my own money and I spend it how I want. To me, right now there's nothing else. There's no one else there and I've decided I'd rather say fuck it and get back to the numbing instead of searching in vain for support because as I said, seeking support is whining. This is survival, any way possible. The world is rough, and even though I've enjoyed helping others, so goddamn much, there are very few people like that, and everyone just like me, is sometimes consumed by their own issues. It is not their job or obligation to help me, and those who do have that job, cost a fucking fortune to even speak to."

suicidewatch,PrincessBubblegum00,2020/3/11,"My family increases my suicidal tendencies I have a complicated family dynamic - my father passed away five months ago from cancer, my mother is disabled due to an illness, and I have a very rocky (understatement) relationship with my younger brother.

I don't want to dive into history here, because it's very long and involves many players, so I would rather stick to the situation at present.

My mom had done A LOT for me. She suffered through my worst phases: depression, rage, suicidal attempts, unemployment, lack of a social circle. She has my eternal gratitude and I live every day feeling like I owe her and should dedicate my life to take care of her, even on account of having a life of my own.

However, my mother and my brother do not accept (or fully understand) my emotional struggles. I have diagnosed by two therapists and a psychiatrist as having tendencies towards a Border Personality Disorder behavior, yet my family (especially my father, when he was alive) disregards it and they that I am only looking for attention, that ""everybody gets a little sad sometimes"" and that I should learn to deal with my ""moods"".

My mother and brother support my seeing a therapist because it takes away from their responsibility to speak to me about my problems (and to their credit, they have listened to me for many, many years), but it's hard implementing any suggestions for a lifestyle change when I come back home and minutes later my mom screams and berates me over something (usually its because she wants me to give her food or make her coffee. Important: my mom cooks all the food in the house. It's the only thing, other than showering, she is able to do without assistance) and everything that my therapist said during the session seems ridiculous and invalid and completely impractical for me in the life that I am living.

My mother has been very depressed ever since she became disable more than a decade ago, and she could never accept herself or her illness and berates herself daily. I have been suffering from depression for more than a decade now, and even though all the therapists suggested I should move out and live independently, and close to my parents, I can never abandon my mother and not be available for her 24/7. I love my mother more than anything and anyone in the world, and I would give what little amount of happiness I have left in me just to see her smile more and love herself.

I have had two suicidal attempts, and I have felt very angry at myself for failing at them. I try to find strength in myself, because now that my father had passed, my mother would be absolutely shattered to lose me as well, and I fear she would try to end her own life after I am gone, but I am hurting very much inside; I do not enjoy living, I do not love myself and I am tired of living two lives: one is the ideal family life I try to achieve during a therapy session and the other is the reality of my dysfunctional family that can never be corrected.

I am actively convincing myself every single day why not just end it, but I am tired and I am sick of crying myself to sleep. I just want it to end."

Say for example I'm eating an ice cream, I enjoy the taste and texture of the ice cream, but that's only because my body is telling me that it tastes nice, and not necessarily that I actually like it. This constantly has me worried that I do not know what I like and because of this I don't feel I have a purpose in life.

This is where I wish I was normal, so that I could live everyday as it comes, get a stable job, enjoy steady paychecks, and purchase items that give me a sense of accomplishment (cars, houses etc.).

suicidewatch,Gentleman_Ghidorah,2020/4/4,"Small rural town living is going to kill me one way or the other; I'd rather it be sooner. Basically, without going too deep into it here (which, given the length of this post, shows you how much I would LIKE to rant and rave about it), how can anyone just be...content...with their lives when there's nothing to do but conform to the local community stereotypes or be shunned from the residing culture as some kind of inconvenience that is merely politely tolerated and encouraged to just shuffle along and be seen and not heard.

Basically, I live in an area that likes to pretend they're not but it's so redneck with the vibe that emanates from the community at large of 'if you aren't a farmer or mechanic or have a passing interest in either, you can just leave'.

Well, I TRIED that 3 times and it's not financially plausible for me because I've hit homelessness each time I tried to break out of this god-forsaken town and had to come crawling back to family and suck up my pride and take handouts to get back on my feet, finding work that is slowly destroying my back and legs because it aggravates old permanent nerve and muscle damage from when I was hit by a car over 10 years ago.

I'm not a drunk nor a druggy. I have always treated those around me with honesty, kindness, and respect (barring some crazy people who I avoid because they really have nothing better to do than stir shit up because they'd rather drag everyone else down to their level instead of even TRYING to pick themselves up). I'm one of those ""too nice"" guys that get overlooked because I'm not overly aggressive and so people walk all over me. I have certainly had enough experiences that I have very foolishly vented onto the internet because I felt it was the only way to cope: by distracting myself with meaningless crap that doesn't matter.

Never been in a relationship but THAT part I'm perfectly okay with because if the only people interested are women who want someone to ""borrow"" money from and men who are sick of striking out with women and would fuck a tree knot if they could find one (and no, I am perfectly straight, I'm disgusted by other men), then I consider being single a goddamned fucking BLESSING.

Since the 3rd attempt to leave, I've tried multiple times to OD on prescription-only painkillers and anti-depressants (my metabolism burns them off so fast that it's like having a mild hangover).

My own parents caught me trying to hang myself and my dad did nothing but berate me like a 5 year old for being ""stupid and spoiled"" when all he wants is a little perfect soldier to bow down to his narcissistic totalitarian rule that I'm not allowed to even have my own opinion about anything because HIS father did the same thing to him.

I am constantly thinking about driving into opposing highway traffic head-on into one of the innumerable stacked logging trucks but am too afraid that I'd merely kill the OTHER person instead of myself.

I've loaded up and had the barrel of my dad's 30-30 in my mouth at least a dozen times but couldn't muster the courage to pull the trigger with my toe. I've also had it pointed at my dad without him knowing at least twice as much but that would have DESTROYED my mother and my nieces and nephews have never been treated like I have, especially them all being under 10 yrs old so they couldn't possibly hope to understand why I'd do anything like that.

My sisters don't 'get' that I genuinely hate our father and that the world would be better off without the two-faced fucking asshole who plays up the public image he's sUcH a GrEaT gUy while doing everything to mentally and emotionally abuse and tear down his one and only son....

It just seems, at times, as though I'm living in a world where I'm the only one self-aware of how bleak living like this is and all I get is mouth service (""oh, it'll get better"", ""don't give up"", etc.) with zero ACTUAL advice or help to make the changes necessary to move on. It's so overwhelming that the process feels like, if I extrapolate, one of those things that won't help me unless I'm basically too old to do anything but collect welfare cheques after any spirit that I might've retained is snuffed out to pursue my interests. Being shown the opportunities others have been given only to be given the metaphorical smack on the wrist and told, 'no, you're not allowed, only them' fills me no longer with rage but, rather, wishful thinking that the next time I close my eyes to sleep is the last thing I ever experience.

Maybe later this year when my mom's terminal cancer finally takes her, it'll be enough to finally push through to finishing myself off since I'll have nothing else good in my life to keep me together."

suicidewatch,throwaway1569815698,2020/3/17,"Almost mid 20s, college dropout, just got a shitty no skill job, been wanting to die, now more than ever To add more context to this, I have been feeling depressed for a long time now. After high school, the person I am dependent on (don't want to get too specific) expected me to goto college, as did myself (I am not pointing fingers, I love them and am grateful to be able to live free with a person like them), I have only myself to blame. To keep my history there short, I have pretty much aimlessly taken classes there for 4 years, and then last year decided on a major, and while I WAS enjoying the work/field/study, I entirely lost all motivation to continue going. Skip a few months of applying to minimum wage filth jobs, I finally got a retail job but quit within a month because I was feeling so fucking depressed about how my life has been turning out, standing in a fucking retail store, pushing boxes to be in line with a shelf, taking items back to said shelves, finally just to go home to either play games until I fall asleep, or sit in bed hating myself without the small distraction from the self hatred and depression I get out of video games. Fast forward a few months to now, the one I live with has somehow gotten a manager pity me into a job, to which I accepted and showed up to today for the first ""orientation"" day (computer based bullshit), then after all the computer stuff, I followed an employee around in said shit position to get an idea about what I'll be doing. Tomorrow I am supposed to go in early and start the real training (or so I'm told, yet my short time in retail tells me I'll be shown the tasks once, and then have to commit them to memory and be expected to execute perfectly day one), however once I came home after 9 hours of that shit, I feel more depressed than I've ever felt before. I felt hungry yet after making some food my appetite vanished, as if I'm not already skinny. After which I cried for about an hour thinking again of my life and future, I am trying to force myself to wake up and show up to that job tomorrow, but I am 90% sure it's going to end up like my ""first"" job, where I fall deeper and deeper into depression because how fucking low these pathetic jobs make me feel about myself, and have to quit before I want to kill myself. My last resort was to join some branch of the military, but I've recently learned it's impossible if you've had an asthma symptom past the age of 13 (had my first one since age 11 a few months ago, yay me). I have no more motivation, I have no more passion, I have no more happiness left in me to want to keep going. The only thing stopping me from just ending it all right now is the one I keep mentioning, I don't want to make them experience the same pain I'm feeling right now."
suicidewatch,DriftyGuardian,2020/3/2,"Why can't I find anyone that will understand what I'm going through or even care? Why can't I just find one fucking person, that even cares what I have to say. It feels really shitty and lonely, and everytime I talk to someone about my depression and mental health, no one seems to give a flying fuck, not even parents, because I'm not technically dying from a disease or tried to commit suicide. 

Just because I haven't tried anything stupid, doesn't mean I don't suffer from suicidal thoughts or think about commiting those acts. I'm not planning anything and don't really want to, but I feel desperate to a point that no solution comes up and suicidal thoughts come in to bogger my mind all the time."

suicidewatch,MrIntrospection,2020/3/16,"How do you satisfy your soul? I would argue that my life satisfaction is a necessary motive for me to exist. The balance between my positive and negative emotions are affected by my behaviour. I may feel positive emotions on one day from exercising and negative emotions on another day from social deprivation. However, I know that on a lot of days I have strong negative emotions that are associated with my child development and past experiences in adolescence. Based on the nature of these experiences I will continue to associate them with my feelings that motivates me towards suicidal thoughts. From what I understand, this is partly why the power in my behaviour that affects my mood is limited, as the relationship between my cognitive development and my negative emotions is strong enough whereby I can do something that affects my emotions positively but instead I experience strong negative emotions. Although my suicidal thoughts will continue to negatively affect my life satisfaction, I feel empowered by the fact that my own behaviour can affect my mood positively and within this fact is my motive to exist. If this argument empowers you in some positive way then I would like to know why."
suicidewatch,nikiwonoto,2020/2/7,"To grow up and being an adult (adulthood) is overrated and depressing When  we grow up  into being an adult, often we are pressured to be  ""realistic"". But at  what cost? Too often, especially when you're not  'lucky/fortunate'  enough, all this whole ""adulthood"" and ""grow up""  things just turned us  into a jaded, weary, bitter, cynical, apathy,  limited, empty, cold, sad, &amp; depressed person/individual..

The   young, youthful, carefree, freespirit, creative, lively, happy, &amp;   dreamy/dreamer ""child"" / ""childhood"" in us often times slowly have   died.. as we grow up into being an adult..

suicidewatch,SongStuckInMyHeadd,2020/3/2,"I'm too much of a coward to do it I'm either too scared to actually do it or I just don't take it seriously enough, I'd love it if I died in a way I didn't have to choose, without worrying about if I flop and end up with an infection or brain damage or severely disabled or disfigured or maybe I'll just have more baggage to carry around for the rest of my life, sometimes it's worrying that there really is an afterlife and I won't get the peace I want, that I won't be remembered how I want to, that nobody will get to see the art that I'm too much of a zombie to get myself to actually create. There were a couple times I nearly did, and the most recent reason I didn't was that I thought it was ridiculous how I'd just get up and do it without saying a word to anyone, how a few minutes ago I was just sitting there calmly and the thought just crossed my mind, I guess I thought I wasn't being dramatic enough for the first time in my life.    A year and a half ago I was sexually assaulted, my mental health was already bad but it just started deteriorating after that to the point I'd silently cry in public, hoping that nobody would notice, I stopped going to school, where it happened, for a while even. I never told a soul, my reasoning being I didn't know who it was, I didn't even initially realize what was going on because that was the first time I had experienced anything like that, nobody would believe me anyway, honestly I feel like MeToo made people believe survivors less, and now I just think that it would be best if I kept this way because my mother said she'd assume my sister were lying if she told my mom that she got raped. I go through cycles where it doesn't affect me as much and the occasion where it does, right now it's just hitting me hard, this time was either caused or exacerbated by me reading some discussions and learning some statistics about sexual assault, and finding out that somebody on a different website I never really even knew died last year, something I was more rocked by than I ever thought I could be from a stranger's death.  I haven't really been functioning, or feeling remotely okay for about a week now, I haven't showered in days, I haven't left the house, I'm ignoring everyone, I'm genuinely considering suicide as an alternative to facing real life.    Sorry if this was hard to read or my grammar was bad, I felt really fucked up while writing this, but I guess everyone who posts here does."
suicidewatch,memelord_mike,2020/4/9,"My career is dead before it could even start, I'm almost structurally unemployed, and I give up. I picked an overcomplicated way to do go down a career path that could have been done more simply. Things didn't pan out as planned and now I'm paying the price for it.

Five years ago, I committed to Wake Forest University for a program that involved doing a physics bachelor's there followed by an MS engineering somewhere else. I made this overly complicated choice because I was able to attend WF for free thanks to financial aid, vs would have been $25K-30K/year at all of the schools I got into that had actual engineering programs, even the ones that did offer me some form of scholarship.

The trying academic environment unpacked a lot of mental baggage I had from a really shitty, abusive upbringing, including, but not limited to debilitating inadequacy, the tendency to dissociate, and generally getting into a cycle of self doubt fueled by underperofmance and underperformance because of self doubt. The school's counseling staff cared more about plugging their own beliefs than diagnosing, let alone treating any of my problems. 

I graduated in May, 2019 with a 2.6 in major and overall GPA. I knew that undergraduate brand wasn't going to compensate for my failings in the eyes of grad recruiters and by halfway through Junior year my faith in my own ability to achieve anything in an academic environment was completely shattered so I didn't even pursue conditional acceptance to an MS program as originally intended. I was supposed to at least graduate with a scholarly paper ready for peer review, but the overworked and underpaid newbie professor who was advising my study resigned the semester we were supposed to finish it, (not faulting her, I would have resigned from an employer exploiting me as badly as they did to her).

My poor credentials compounded with the zero shits given about undergraduate brand in STEM, and the fact that a physics bachelors without advanced degrees is virtually useless narrowed my career options drastically and effectively guaranteed I wouldn't have a job lined up on graduation.

I spent 4 months at home, my health getting worse from the stress of living with my soulless abusers in NY, until I found a remedial job that was willing to wait for me to relocate. I moved back to my college town just to be far away from them and in an area I was sort of familiar with. I've gone through 3 of such remedial jobs since that move, all of which I've been fired for basically out of mercy. IE, my manager would tell me ""it seems like you're not a good fit for this industry"" during my exit interview. And they're right, a non-physical-specimen nerd like me doesn't belong in landscaping, manufacturing, or warehousing. It's not a good match either way The last of these jobs ended in February a smidgen before Virus-mania started.

Due to my terrible credentials, I've only gotten 5 interviews, in spite of hundreds, maybe thousands of job applications submitted, and having professional resume revision. Two were for medical laboratory roles, one was for an academic research position, one was for assistant laboratory management, and most recently, one was for a technical writer position at a software company. The rejection email for the last one came this morning and I want to die.

It's the same story every time, the first one or two recruiters/hiring managers will entertain my candidacy, then the highest-up has a hard-and-fast requirement I don't meet (such as X number of years in a certain industry, Y amount of credit hours in a certain subject, etc...) and I get told to F off.

The virus panic reigned hell on the job market and it's only going to put under-experienced people like me in even worse standing when things go back to ""normal"" and everybody's looking to job-hop because of the dissatisfaction with their employers overworking them from home without OT pay. I'm not even going to hold a candle to most of these people and the lack of experience on my part is becoming a fatal catch 22. 

There aren't a lot of second chances for someone in my position, and I can't fault any employers for not wanting to take a chance on me when there are hordes of qualified people to choose from. I have about $11k In savings, maybe a little more after the stimulus check comes in. It might be time to invest that in a burial plot with a witty grave marker and take a dirt nap."

suicidewatch,pandaappleblossom,2020/3/18,"Depression at different stages of life I told the doctor how low I was feeling recently and just wanted to share what she said, along with some anecdotal stuff. Teens-- I have a lot of friends who were very, very depressed as teens. I wasn't. I had anxiety and feelings like I couldn't go on sometimes, but in general, I was pretty engaged in life, though I faced insecurity and bullying, I had a couple close friends that I could be myself with.  I have had several friends who were depressed as teens though, and a lot of them somehow 'grew' out of it- or more likely, somehow their brains or hormones or life situation changed enough to make them feel more balanced to tolerate life.  For me though, I got depressed later in life, and I read an article or two to suggest there are some people who don't really severely struggle with depression until their 30s, like me. Anyway, I talked to the doctor recently and she told me it was not my fault, that it was all genetic and chemical, and had nothing to do with anything I wasn't doing or anything I was doing wrong. 

Of course, it's hard for me to believe her. I feel like it is my fault. But when I see other people who aren't depressed, I don't think their lives are necessarily so much better than mine or anything, and she is a doctor, so maybe there is truth to what she said. I wanted to share this here because it seems like so many of us do hit a low point at certain stages in our lives, and what the doctor said, along with reflecting on what I've read and know about other people, kind of relieves some of the guilt and burden for me, and I was wondering how some of you deal with the guilt and shame of all of this, or if any of you have accepted it to not be your fault somehow."

Now, what sickens me here is that im pretty much 90% sure that some of the content I ended up watching (1 or 2 videos) was actual rape footage uploaded to kinky porn sites, at that age I was ignorant and weren't empathetic enough to really understand how awful that videos actually were

* My mother yelling at me at 15

* Being targeted online at 19

It continues to affect me all day every day, without any end to it anytime soon.

This affected me in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and seems to be continuing in 2020.

I started going back to counseling regularly to cope with the death of my mom, I joined a support group to help deal with my intense fear of abandonment, and I have rid myself of a lot toxic relationships while simultaneously strengthening the relationships with people who honestly and truly care for me. Other then some ongoing physical health problems, life has been relatively okay. This being said I¡¯ve been having a really bad mental health week. One where suicide has really been plaguing my mind, and I can¡¯t shake this feeling that the people I love and care about most would benefit more if I was not around. I know these are just harmful thoughts, the talk of an overwhelmed brain who has been hurt countless times in it¡¯s lifetime, and who still can¡¯t comprehend that all the times it was made to feel like it didn¡¯t deserve life was just due the toxicity of people who cared little. The people I have in my life now would be hurt, if not crushed, if I wasn¡¯t around anymore. I really and truly know this in my heart, but yet my brain tends to rationalize my potential death and list every possible reason why the world would be better off without me cluttering it. 

I can say with confidence that I won¡¯t try it, but it doesn¡¯t make it any less painful or overwhelming to be going on my fourth night of thinking about it and heavily considering it. To envision a future where my friends, my mentor, and my family will live happily without my annoying constant texting, my frequent need for validation, my frequent anxiety attacks over all things, and my overall nuisance of a presence. For some reason my brain pictures them living stress free, peaceful lives with smiles on their face. I know this more then likely wouldn¡¯t be the case. After all, experiencing the loss of someone really changes a person. Even if they don¡¯t love and care for me as much as I¡¯ve tricked myself into believing, I am sure they would be even the tiniest bit sad if I wasn¡¯t around anymore, and maybe they would even miss my 50-something texts a day."

suicidewatch,sonofagun5050,2020/3/14,"To those who are suffering Read my story hopefully it helps. If you feel as if your life is beyond repair, I am living with a rare disease and worst of all I brought it upon myself. 

I've been a sex and porn addict for half my life since I was 12. I damn that day when I was shown porn as a child everyday. I made serious efforts to heal throughout my life, but I was never able to go more than a few weeks without finding myself at a strip club, with an escort, or watching porn. Finally in 2019 I felt my sexual health declining, but I somehow bounced back, graduated university, and even met the woman of my dreams, it felt like divine intervention came to save me. The problem is just before I met her, I had relapsed. This relapse proved costly because I developed a disease.

This disease that inflicts me very well may be the culprit of my penile tissue fibrosis and my prostate calcifications, as diagnosed by ultrasound. I have gone around the world to top doctors who tried but couldn't help me (although there are still avenues to explore), it is unknown if the problem is neurological or autoimmune or whatever else this blasted thing is. My health is declining and I can honestly say that I don't know if I will ever get to be a husband and father, and I bear this load only being in my 20s. Life may get more difficult if and when I have to reveal my situation to family and friends as we all age and move on in life. I couldn't  even imagine having to lose that girl I love. If my condition is to get worse the only purpose I see in life is to become a priest, to join the military and go off to the other side of the world, or to spend my life researching and hopefully discovering cures for diseased people who can't be treated.

No matter how depressed you are, if you have your physical health, rejoice, simply rejoice in this, your health is so precious it is a chest of hidden happiness and endless hope for you, because if you have your health you always have a chance in life no matter what has happened to you. In these last 8 months I've come to the realization that life is more than becoming successful, it is actually through suffering that we are born and become great people. If you think of all historical figures that transcended simply being successful but had a significant and meaningful impact on humanity, all of these great people had suffered immensely at some point. It is through suffering that we develop a heart  for others who are unfortunate and who are suffering, a humility. Before this happened to me I would never look twice at a person with a mental/genetic/physical disorder, but nowadays I am almost brought to tears when I see such a person at church, just like my heart reaches out to your stories when I read them on this reddit. It is through suffering that we develop character but also a true meaning in life that never fades away, for our purposes and desires when everything in our life is going well are usually vain and don't last very long. For example if I wasn't inflicted I likely wouldn't be here in this moment trying to help somebody in need, but instead I would be in some vain pursuit of pleasure. Finally it is through suffering that we find our true selves and become free because only through suffering can we shed our pride, and pride is ultimately our weakness for it is injury to our pride that causes us constant emotional suffering when things don't go our way.

suicidewatch,FemorisEnthusiast,2020/2/8,"I need help moving forward   

I feel weird typing this, I¡¯ve lived with phases of depression and anxiety since I was 11 when I first established an idea of how I could best kill myself. I¡¯ve managed until tonight at the age of 22 under the idea that eventually I will die regardless, and my odds of finding some concept of happiness cannot be guaranteed in whatever state there is after death that our limited minds cannot reasonably conceptualize. 

This last year, and January more specifically has been difficult enough that for the first time in 3 years I have been considering it again. However with my understanding of the human body from the course I¡¯ve been studying the last year, I do not believe I will fail if I try. I have considered seeking help from an organisation, but from the same course I also know the procedures and codes of professional standards relating to someone categorised as a high suicide risk. Without doubt in my mind I would be institutionalized, at the very least temporarily.

3 years ago I met a lovely lady, she is about 5 years older than I, at the time I was training to join the ADF, I marked in top 10% of all applicants, I was offered a pathway to all bar 1 job within the ADF, if I went back to highschool and completed a year 10 equivalency test, which I had never done throughout my years of homeschooling. I had also been working 35-40 hours a week between filming football and performing overnight/maintenance shifts at a Mcdonalds. Out of pride and arrogance I spited the idea of going back for a test that I had already proven myself competent of, and turned my back on entry to the ADF. The lovely lady I mentioned already comforted me and we started dating long distance. Early in the relationship she had stressed the idea of having family and being married before the age of 30, which I carried to heart until last month. After a year together, I used the money I¡¯d been pocketing for the 2 years prior and moved across the country to live with her. After 6 months I hadn¡¯t managed to find a job, was very nearly broke and had put back on 20 of the 30 kg I lost in the process of trying to join the ADF.

At this point I got a job at a factory, started working 40 hours a week, on a complete different sleeping schedule to my partner and no friends within 500km of me. Within a month I was coping with heavy alcohol usage which continued for the next 2 months, until just after I¡¯d had my casual contract ended to bring in a new wave of overseas labour hire, who weren¡¯t being paid the additional benefits that citizens were, within 2 weeks of losing that job my grandmother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. At this point I reduced my drinking to a quarter, got a new job doing maintenance work again, began discussing with my partner ways I could get a qualification, while continuing to contribute financially. Things were looking good. We had a plan that involved my moving back across the country to begin studying nursing, which would also provide me some of the skills to help take care of my grandmother and take advantage of a government initiative which involved paying for my study fees completely.

Within 3 months my grandmother passed. Living with my family again, I had taken on a good chunk of the household management and listening/supporting while my mother talks of how she wishes she was dead and the weight she needs to lose and how she wants me to help do that. Coming forward to December, I had saved my last few paychecks from filming football, skipped meals, avoided luxuries so I could save enough money to fly to see my partner again. Every piece of university work I could do I had done, lecturers knew I would be away during the break and my partner and I had been discussing getting married, she¡¯d asked if I would want her to take my name, talked about dates, best men and bridesmaids. The only detail that was missing was a proposal, so for this coming trip I planned to fill in that blank. I made plans to make a ring from the files and tools I¡¯d restored from her grandfathers neglected workshop.

Within a week of the trip to visit her, without any mention of a proposal, she left me. Stating feels of anxiety about what she wanted and that I¡¯d always felt more than her, that she didn¡¯t know if she actually wanted a family anymore, I found out in this same trip that she¡¯d joined a new gaming group, been made an admin for it, met half a dozen new guys within this group, all 3 months before my trip, having never mentioned it.

I¡¯ve spent the last year trying to meet new people, classmates, new gaming groups, just as friends. Even tried some R4R posts and meetnewpeople reddit pages. With no result. Even offers to be invited to parties that I¡¯ve accepted from classmates, the inviters either deflected me trying to get details after I¡¯ve accepted or simply never got around to it.

And now I sit here, alone, broke, studying a course that I do not take satisfaction from, in a household where I have become emotionally depended upon. Slightly tipsy from having gone to a pub to try and meet new people after having read it as advice from a reddit page on meeting people, only to not have the courage, having spent the $25 I had set aside to buy a cricket ticket from my brother, on 2 fucking pints of guinness. I feel confused, betrayed, weak and a failure, with no clue how to interact with people anymore.

Apologies the post is so long, thank you for listening."

All I've heard since I was 15 was that I wasn't doing enough, and now after a shitty breakup, moving back in with parents, and hearing all my shortcomings again, it makes me feel so worthless, and all I can think is how much I want these feelings to stop, and the only way I can think is by not being here anymore. I punch myself in the head when I get overwhelmed, or if I say something that made a situation worse. It scares people around me if they happen to see, but all I want is a hug right now, and for someone to hold me, and let me cry, but I don't have anyone who would accept me in that state, not even my mother.

suicidewatch,PianoMan2001,2020/1/6,"This is my last reach for meaningful advice I find myself bewildered as to why I even post to this particular forum as I can guarantee it won't be seen by many; I don't seek for sympathy or empathy, I just simply desire answers.

Let's start with the reason I am writing this; in essence, I don't want to be alive or in the realms of existence; I wish to not exist in any universe parallel to ours, and I goddamn hope that there is some way to erase my existence on this planet, in this given dimension. Let's outline a few reasons why I feel so horrid towards my existence and everything to do with me: I was born into a toxic family of whom encouraged deception, violence, bullying, racism, homophobia, lies, etc. It's fair to assume their moral compass was fucked up, that's for sure. Since I was younger, to cut a long story short, I was exposed to varying levels of physical, sexual and verbal abuse which resulted in a lot of migration to different towns, housing and schools. This uncertain level of instability has haunted me until this very day, as my so called 'parents' have never supported me despite my background. I went through school being constantly bullied due to my cheap, unclean clothing which induced an uncontrollable feeling of no self worth, no human qualities. From being locked in my room from a young age to being left to fend for myself, anyone I have been in the care of has disregarded my feelings and emotions and desensitised/dehumanised me to the extent whereby I do not feel human anymore. Right now, I feel completely empty and lost, and the saddest thing is, no one can help me emotionally and financially. Money will always be tight and I am so far gone mentally that I know I cannot be saved. I can't be saved.

I will never comprehend why my circumstances were extremely different to those of my past friends. They live 'stable' and relatively 'normal' lives, without unethical behaviour and a stable mindset. All I would have wanted was stability, morality and a stable, growing environment. So, the question is, will this really ever get better from those with experience in this living construct? Or, is it worth just finding the painless way to remove my existence?"

Don't have to grow old

Never coerced into labor again

Don't have to deal with the inhumanity and alienation caused by the market

No more fear of consequences

Feeling of peace after finally deciding when and how to die

Could survive and have a new outlook on life

Could survive and gain the love and sympathy lacking before

Would legitimize the severity of own depression

Don't have to try to perform damage control

No longer conscious of the absurd horror of the world

Taking full control of own destiny

Small reactionary victory

Probably don't get to see the progression of history moving forward

Pets would be lost and confused

Ultimate guilt

Terror in last moments

Possible feedback/looping of timeline

Next reality could be worse than the current or even worse than none at all

Can't help in a future revolution

-Statistically unlikely to be successful even given access to most lethal means

Failed attempt could lead to a vegetative state or severely paralyzed

Failure results in revoking of certain rights

Failure carries negative social stigma

Failure means time spent locked in a ward

Failure means family and friend dynamics are never the same

Failure will most likely result in stricter rules within parents house

Failure likely means confronting some kind of buried tauma-

Could inspire family and friends to do the same

More lethal methods are messier and more traumatic

Losing chance to explore identity more

Dying full of regret

Dying a virgin

Accusations of being a coward

Never experienced love"
suicidewatch,thrownawaylife267,2020/4/14,"I Wrote a 5-Page Suicide Note With this whole quarantine business, I've had plenty of time to contemplate my past actions, and I've come to the conclusion that some of my past habits are simply unforgivable, and I plan to kill myself if I can't find some way to get past it in the next 30 days. I've always struggled with porn addiction, and over time, through chasing the high, I went to darker and darker places. I stooped so low as loli porn, and while I denounce my past actions involving it, I simply don't see how I can move forward past it. It's simply not something I can forgive myself for, and anyone who I hope to get close to in the future may see the same.


I can logic it out in my brain that it was just my chasing the high as I got more desensitized to ""vanilla"" porn, but that borderline illegal shit is just too far for me to reconcile. I can't see an out and my shame has me back against a wall.


Like I said, I'm giving myself a few days to see if it magically gets better like some people say it does, but I really don't see that happening. If anyone has any advice for how I can forgive myself and move on, or any advice to address my fears that I'll never be able to be open with anyone again, it would be greatly, greatly appreciated."

This is kind of real for hormones and these produce pheromones. Anyone can feel a certain way within, and this has a direct impact in others.

 I'm tired of feeling useless, I'm tired of impulsively self-harming, I'm tired of living with a chronic condition, forcing myself to quarantine first, being weak and sick all the time and having to eat a shit, expensive diet as a result. I'm probably Bipolar or maybe even a narcissist because I have insane mood swings and I get angry incredibly easily while worrying about myself wayy too much, and I can't access mental health support because I'm in the fucking US and lost my health insurance due to losing my job. Quarantine and being around my direct family has exacerbated all of these, I've lost all my coping mechanisms and been punching myself 10-25 times a day. I can't take this, time to catch the train one last time."
suicidewatch,Fragrant_Vanilla,2020/3/17,"Due to no fault of my own, I will be given the choice to isolate myself completely, die, or live the rest of my life attached to a machine I have been formally diagnosed with several learning disabilities, which means that my low risk family will have to leave the house and order food online for me.  The learning disabilities (low functioning autism and severe hydrocephalus) cause me to have a very weak immune system.  If I catch anything worse than a cold, I will either die or spend the rest of my life immobile, severely brain damaged and hooked up to a machine.

I hope to die now because nothing is worse than being alone in the dark (my dad puts the electric in and without him I can't do it myself because it requires a ladder and my hydrocephalus means I have no balance).

I hope to kill myself before the 23rd when my family will be ordered to leave the house and leave me with no electricity.  Even if they were allowed to stay, the electricity will still run out and I will still spend nights in complete darkness."

suicidewatch,stoetry,2020/3/23,"Thanking Admin for Bringing to My Attention Phrases That I Thought Would Help, But Could Actually Hurt. I want to thank you for taking the time to point out this issue. I was a bit naive in thinking that when a person reaches a point where they want to end thier life, the community would come together and try to help save that person. I have taken it for granted that people who know the severity of the situation, knowing that human beings are ending their lives, would go in ""automatic compassion mode"" and offer help in trying to change these people's minds, hoping they give life a second chance.

It never dawned on that there were people who actually would suggest that someone should go ahead with their planned to commit suicide. I guess I should had known better, as we are living in a violet and sometimes, very antisocial world so people like this really do exist.

The information you provided is very helpful to someone like myself, because you have just highlighted phrases that I could have possibly said thinking I am helping when in reality, I am actually making the situation worse. This will keep me on my guard going forward.

 This is not an easy subject, some of us feel that it is our responsibility as fellow human beings to do something about people trying to take their lives. It is a very fragiles situation. For those of us who want to help, we know that we are trodding on egg shells when  talking to someone who believes they have had it, and who wants to end it all.

We have to be aware there are highly charged emotions on display and there are individuals who are waiting on information that could change their way of thinking and could possibly turn their lives around. For whatever it's worth, wanting to help is just the first step, (as I'm currently finding out)
knowing what to say and when to say it, is totally on another level. 

That's why a lot of people shy away from this subject. But for me, I'm not going to stop giving advice just because someone may say something that I don't agree with. I have to keep in mind that even though some may reject my efforts to help and disregard my suggestions, there are others who may find those suggestions very helpful and for that person, I am willing to stay and find a way out together."

All of it just came crashing, because the girl i was chasing for years, just told me she got into a relationship to the one and only best friend i thought to be real to me. I was very well prepared to make the decision of just getting over it, as i cant control who people fall in love with but, she also told me the first times they went out and started seeing each other. And really unfortunately, it was during the time when i was still having very hard feelings for her, and the worst part is: my ¡°best friend¡± knew about my feelings, he was the only one in this world i had told such things and secrets, and even during that time he was just going out behind my back with the girl, for which i cried in front of him probably just hours earlier before they had dates.
I really need advice because just when i thought i had everything set and thought i was finally going to be happy, i just feel empty and alone again having lost this ¡°best friend¡± and he doesnt even have the ideea that i found out about it. I really have no clue how to come out through this.

suicidewatch,ScrombulousRex,2020/1/25,"The life that I struggled to build crumbled in an instant when an accident left me crippled. Four years ago, at 23, I pulled myself out of the pit of depression and isolation that self-destructive youth and failed career aspirations had left me in and I started all over again. I enrolled in a university program and busted my ass becoming the best student they had, it was absolute hell and the stress and pressure nearly destroyed me but I graduated with a perfect GPA, a bunch of academic awards and accolades, and my graduate thesis scored highest in the state. The University employed me as a researcher, I was preparing my thesis for publication, and was about to start my PhD with full scholarship. I met a girl in one of my courses and fell in love for the first time in my life, and after three years together we became engaged in November. Things were often complicated and the relationship was a lot of work to keep strong but we loved and supported each other and it was the most beautiful thing I have ever experienced in life, better than I ever could have imagined. By the time that we graduated I had saved a little money from my casual jobs and was able to finally buy a decent car and had enough left to travel around Europe together for a few months between graduation and beginning post-grad studies. At the end of the year we were preparing to move in together, to start the new chapter of our lives, and we were closer and happier than we had ever been. We spend New Years eve at the beach, drove up the coast to break in the new car and spend the day reveling in each others company and excited about the new year about to start. That afternoon I was in an accident that effectively destroyed part of my leg, leaving me unable to walk.

I underwent extensive reconstructive surgery on my leg, replacing the destroyed bone and tissue with a combination of metal and grafts taken from elsewhere in my body. I'm told that it was successful and that with half a year or so of rehabilitation I should make a close-to-full recovery. But in the mean time, I'm immobile. In the weeks since the surgery managing the pain has become a full time occupation. I haven't been able to work on my thesis or on my other research work in my current state, so I've had to delay or pass up most of the opportunities that had opened up for me after graduation and they were eagerly snapped up by some of my colleagues who almost seemed to view my accident as a golden opportunity for themselves. My friends seem to have disappeared into the woodwork, seemingly not wanting to deal with me until I recover. And then there's my fianc¨¦. I always doted on her and did a lot for her, but now I can't drive, can't pick her up or go to comfort her when she's upset, cant get food or gifts or perform romantic gestures from my bed, and the strain is starting to show. She promised when it happened that it didn't matter to her, it didn't change anything, and that she would do everything she could to support me through it, but she has steadily come to see me less and less often, fewer and fewer texts, she almost seems to wince and look away uncomfortably when she looks at me and she has shown no affection or desire for intimacy since the accident. It's got to the point where I barely saw her at all this week, and this evening I tried to talk to her about it she blew up at me and angrily blamed me for not pulling myself up by my bootstraps and immediately overcoming the major surgery i just had to continue my life and my role in her life as it had been before the accident. The angry tirade concluded with the emphatic declaration that she doesn't want to deal with this anymore and would rather be alone.

I'm lying here alone, staring at my ceiling, waiting until I can take my next batch of painkillers. Just like I have been spending every day and night since the operation. I can't help but wish that it had been my neck that was damaged in the accident, so that I could have ended on that new years eve when I was happy, with the woman I loved and eager for the future. Or if I had never woken from the anesthetic in the operation, so that I could at least have died thinking that she still loved me and my last thoughts could have been of her. But instead I'm here tonight with nothing more to show for my efforts these past years but a broken body and a broken heart, telling you all my story to take my mind off the pain for a while. I don't think that I really know what I want or who I am, after all of this, much less what to do next."

suicidewatch,downandoutinChicago,2020/3/22,"It's spiritually exhausting having to pick yourself up over and over again This time last week, I was pulling myself out of a depressive episode and feeling good about the next couple of months in which I was going to be subletting my apartment for April and May and doing some freelance writing while traveling for those two months. I also just negotiated a deal to sell my house to a real estate developer for a very good price, but contingent on a zoning change which could take 6-7 months to get.

On Weds, my subletters (who had already paid me their first month's rent to secure the apartment) asked if they could cancel the lease due to the ongoing Coronavirus public health emergency. They also wanted their $1,600 first month's rent back. That's over $3,000 I was counting on having over the next two months to help cover my bills. Just hours later, the editor I was talking with about doing some freelance projects wrote me to say that they were putting my stuff on hold until this situation shakes out. And the buyer for my property I'm working with is anxious and I just don't know if he's going to continue pursuing the deal. 

I went from having my spring and possibly early summer months sorted out to being back to zero and desperately seeking income. I made a post on Facebook asking for any leads anyone had for work, and most people suggested I go work for a local grocery store. I went to a job fair for an Amazon delivery gig on Friday and it sounds like it may work out, but it's tough going back to the hourly wage life when you know you're qualified and capable of earning a decent salary. 

I've spent this entire last week in bed, fighting the urge to go out back and put myself out of my misery. I can't think straight and have been trying to sleep as much as I can these last few days so that I don't have to think about anything or make any decisions. I've had to go through this so many times in the past, but just in the last six weeks, I've suffered through three severe depressive and suicidal episodes. The last two I had to just ride out and hope that I was going to come out the other end with some clarity and a will to make the moves I need to make for a better life. But now? I want to put an end to the inevitable suffering and uncertainty of these next few months. I just don't think I can take much more of it."

suicidewatch,Mordec13,2020/1/18,"No future, all hope is lost Here is my life story, that I want to share at least somewhat anonymously online, as access to mental health services are difficult to access where I live, and I am ashamed to tell this to the people who know me. Thank you for reading my long text :)

The relevant information starts by me having a history of being bullied throughout elementary school and high school, which is equivalent to grades 1-11 in the US. I was relentlessly rejected and excluded from social interactions, tormented, called names, and even threatened many times. There were even instances where the teachers would join in.

Given this situation, I tended to focus only on school and on getting good grades, as that was one of the only areas I could excel in. I was also overweight, out of shape, and not prone to practicing sports as I was furthermore excluded from the teams by the people rejecting me elsewhere. This all led to me excelling academically, and I ended up getting a scholarship at one of my country's most prestigious universities near the end of grade 11.

But that is just where my story begins: merely a few days after getting said scholarship, I had just finished one of my final exams, and was asked to sign someone's graduation book. Then, out of nowhere, I get punched in the back of the head from someone behind the bench. It nearly knocked me unconscious it was so strong. After a few seconds, I get up and find it was one of the persons that was threatening me all along high school. I got up only to get chased by him and fall down tripping on concrete. 

This incident left me with serious scars of which I still feel the effects; I suffered of debilitating headaches for 6 months afterwards. I also have what I'm guessing is a form of PTSD from the event even two years after. Also importantly, it left me with decreased motivation and increased difficulty to grasp new concepts even though the headaches are now gone.

The above scars only go through what has been directed directly from the incident - not to mention the ongoing criminal court case that is still ongoing even all this time after and that only contributes to my PTSD as I have to relive the events when I went through cross-examination, and filling out a whole series of legal documents.

This leaves me with my academic situation that has been deteriorating throughout the time since the incident. Where I live, we do not go through to university immediately after high school, but rather have to attend a two year intermediary college. It is here that things have just gone completely downhill, I started failing classes, but still mostly passing through and telling myself that all is OK. It is only this past semester where I completely tanked and failed 5 of my 7 classes. My self-assessed reasons for this decline are my ever-declining motivation and the fact that I had the hearings of my court case in which I was cross-examined and had to relive all the pain of the events, and deal with the opposing lawyer calling me a blatant liar. I did not show external signs of distress but they did get reflected in my grades. 

So here I am with a complete failed semester that happened to be the last one before university admissions - I won't be able to get to college. The scholarship is now gone. I am now really stuck in a situation where I can't get out of this mess and try to retake classes, as they aren't available in the winter at my college. I have not yet told my parents who have saved up a lot of money for me to go to university, that I won't be able to go. I feel like killing myself rather than having to tell them. They certainly won't buy the PTSD thing at all, as I have mentioned it before and they brushed it off entirely saying they would try to get me help, but none came and they forgot about it all the while continuing to blame me for my bad grades. So finally (Yes, I acknowledge you kind reader if you have read up until here, thank you so much for wanting to know about me and possibly help!) here I am at 19 with a now-difficult path to getting a college degree at all - and hence a bleak future, and caught in a horrible situation. I feel so bad of myself and ashamed that I screwed up this semester and let me and my family down that I constantly feel like killing myself to the point of having trouble sleeping at night. What can I do in this situation?"

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't get better. If anything, it got worse. I came out as transgender to my mother and her new bf (who isn't a dick) and they're supportive, but this supposed LGBT friendly country doesn't care enough to put enough gender teams in a country so the waiting times are 1.5 years to almost 2 years just to get a first consultation.

On top of that, I have no income anymore, part because I moved to a clinic for reasons unrelated to the transgenderism. This made my income void and reapplying is taking literal months, to the point where I have to go against laws in this country and have no healthcare to literally scrape by with what I have. Alongside that, the chronic fatigue is still as prevelant as ever, and making it impossible to get a job and actually support myself.

Honestly, everything one after another just made me aware of my old thoughts on society and humanity as a whole to be more and more true. Society and human nature is based on backstabbing, throwing away people with no value, and selfishness.

I've already begun the process of cutting off people out of my life because of my increasingly toxic behavior socially for their good, in the hopes that they will eventually forget about me so I can end my life without many regrets. Of course I am aware people will be sad, such as my mother. But people forget and move on. That too, is the selfishness of humans. 

I have not considered if I will leave a note or not, but I have decided on my method of suicide, which will need time and preparation, as I am not a fan of methods such as jumping in front of a train or jumping off a building. They create too much damage to the environments, and leave enough of a chance of survival that I am not willing to do those. Medication overdose would be an optional second choice right now, using a combination of antidepressants, sleeping medication, painkillers and ibuprufen. However, ammassing enough to make the chance of survival low would take time, along with being unsure how much pain it will inflict. Thus, my current preferred method has become an exit bag, otherwise known as a suicide bag. As expected, though, this takes time to prepare, as the lack of an income will make it fairly hard to gather the tools needed for a painless and peaceful death.

I would want to thank people that have tried to help someone like me, though, for being the outliers that prove the fact of humanity, but my life has become a subject that's better left to die off alone. I don't want to have to end it like this, but everything logically points to this being the best option and route to take."

I assume that it was still fused to the glans and would have detached without any intervention when hitting puberty. 

All my sexual partners up to now where intact. That¡¯s the reason why I know very precisely how much harm circumcision has caused to me. The foreskin is the most sensitive part of the penis. When it gets removed, the amount of sexual pleasure one can feel after the surgery is greatly diminished. Whenever it comes to encounters with intact men, I feel inferior to them because they seem to enjoy sex so much more than I do. Most of the time however, I get rejected beforehand because of my mutilated and incomplete genitals. Since circumcision can¡¯t be undone up to now, the situation burdens me every day. I can¡¯t even use the toilet or taking a shower without being remembered of my situation. I simply can¡¯t brush aside what was done to me when I was a defenseless child. I feel doomed and my situation seems so hopeless that thoughts of suicide are omnipresent in every waking hour.

There is also a subreddit r/CircumcisionGrief, where men in a similar situation like me can exchange their thoughts. 

I tried out a shitload of antidepressants and other psychiatric drugs but none of them were really working. I simply can¡¯t deal with the fact that something so precious and delicate has been robbed of me without my consent. I get rejected when I try to hookup with other men in almost 95% of all cases because of this. My depression got so severe that it resulted in unemployment and disability even though I have two academical degrees in a very well-paid area. 

I hope this post serves as a warning for all parents who seriously consider circumcision for their sons. It has ruined lifes and drove people into suicide and has exactly ZERO health benefits. The only reason I am still here today is my own cowardliness to kill myself."

The past few years have not been easy for me, before I started a school program in the last few months for earlier school leavers, I had no friends for about 8 years. I was diagnosed with ADHD, OCD, social anixety, general anxiety, etc when I was about 5 years old, and was expelled from mainstream school as a result, going into special needs schools until I couldn't take it anymore and refused to go, leaving secondary education at age 12-13. The next few years, I picked up drinking, and smoking, along with a few drugs such as cocaine, hash/weed, before almost going to juvi for an assault as a result. At age 14 I attempted my first suicide, my second a few months later, my next at age 15, and my last a few days before Christmas 2019, this one as a result of losing the only real girlfriend I've ever had after finding out she was cheating on me before we even officially started dating.

What I'm getting at here, is that something is keeping me here, I'm not religious, I've never been afraid of pain or death, but something is keeping me here. Remember there is hope, even if you don't think it, someone out there loves you, and would do anything to make you happy, remember there is hope."

However, there are these poisonous seeds for under $5 that could be turned into seasoning and put on my food and maybe people will think I died from a plant seed or I could plant the seeds in my backyard and let them grow and then use that as a way to go without the thought of suicide from others. They would possibly think, ¡°Oh, she went outside and played with the dog near this deadly plant¡±. And in this way everyone wins. I¡¯ve already thought of stabbing my carotid artery with a knife, starving the body for 30-60 days, turning on the gas stove without the fire, falling asleep, and doing while everyone is gone, but these would be seen a suicide, which sucks.

I'm back in the UK now after living in the USA with her so access to a gun is difficult, so today I went to the hardware store and bought 10 foot of rope. Only my family visiting for tea was enough to stop me using it.

suicidewatch,nofapsuperpowers1,2020/2/3,"Seek to understand If you want to help someone suicidal (or yourself), refrain from 'you are loved' , 'people will miss you' , 'think of how others would take damage because of you' , 'it¡®s the easy way out you¡®ll regret it'.

None of the things I listed above are even remotely helpful. People who are suicidal do not feel loved,missed, and have very little interest to run into the risk of regret. They don¡®t want to get generic advice,or, any advice. Don¡®t tell them 'you are not alone' or that 'I understand how you feel'. Suicidality is one of the most lonely, isolating experiences and despite hundreds of thousands of people in this sub, it still does feel like the most alienating experience one could go through. 

Suicidal people want nothing more than being understood, without the pressure of judgment, without being shamed of how they feel, without getting generic advice. They do not want to be told what is wrong with them, what 'self-help' trick is gonna fix them, or be asked 'have you tried meditation?' 

If you at all care about 'helping¡® someone, remove yourself the idea of helping them. Seek to understand them, be curious about how they feel, let them feel the way they feel &amp; just give them your unconditional presence. Non-judgmental attention, empathy and understanding will provide anyone with a foundation for healing and relief. I know this to be illogical and against general consensus, but I found this to be the baseline to help someone.

suicidewatch,throwaway909309,2020/1/18,"I am lost.  

Hello.  

I¡¯ve been suffering from diagnosed severe depression and anxiety for almost two years. In these past 2 years, I have experienced so much excruciating mental pain, suffering, and despair. I spend every single day in the deepest hole that I will never be able to dig myself out of. My anxiety makes every second a personal purgatory, coping with stress over minuscule details and deadlines. This past month has hit me particularly hard. I have been in a relationship for almost two years in a couple of months, but this relationship has been rocky over the past 6 months. This relationship was originally the only thing keeping me from ending my life, hoping I had a future with this woman. Slowly, as the disagreements and arguments advance, I can feel this future and all of our plans slipping away. There is a disagreement or argument every other day, and this just adds to my deep despair. This relationship has become especially difficult in recent weeks and days, and as it deepens, I realize how much pain I truly am in. I take 100mg of Zoloft daily, I attend therapy sessions, and I have supportive friends who are aware of my struggles, however, none of these have helped my deep feelings of pain and suffering. My childhood was filled with physical, verbal, and mental abuse that continues to this day through my divorced parents¡¯ ¡°cold war¡± and my father¡¯s continued harassment and belittlement. Figures that assumed roles of mentorship and support slowly delve into roles of mental torture. Through my experiences with depression and anxiety, I have never been able to escape the comforting thought of finally losing everything that has continuously caused dread and despair. Underneath everything, my mind is in a war within itself. Underneath everything, my anxiety is causing stress over the most efficient method of ending my life. I am mentally unable to continue escaping these feelings and I feel myself delving deeper and deeper into a dark inescapable void. I am unaware of how long I can continue feeling this way without taking an action that ends everything."

I will continue to search for a more sure and painless way to die. It's pretty funny how I see life despite still being so young, but I think I've seen enough. I just hope the people close to me are going to be better off without me and fix all of the mistakes my existence bought on them.

suicidewatch,AkaviriForever,2020/3/25,"What more can I do to support and help my suicidal girlfriend? Hey everyone, new to reddit here, so please forgive me if I'm posting in the wrong place. I need some help with what more I can do to help my girlfriend through a very difficult time she's having, so here's the full story.

We've been dating the last 9 months roughly, and this is a bit of a long distance relationship where she lives 90 miles away. Every weekend, she'd come over to my place and we always met in the middle to make the strain of driving in her less, and I'd drive her back to the city with me. She's 24, and I'm 23(M).

She told me upfront that she had depression and anxiety issues, and I didn't back away because I don't believe that those are reasons not to love someone. She's had a few panic attacks and breakdowns while she's been with me each weekend since we've been dating, and I've been able to console her each time, but this time it's much worse.

We ended up breaking up in late January, and she explained to me later a week later that it was because it felt like she was disappointing me, which I reassured her that wasn't the case at all. It was largely (in my opinion) her anxiety and depression beginning to spike. We end up getting back together a week later, and things are beginning to go back to normal, but she wants to take things slow and see where it goes from there. Around February 20th-29th, I could tell she was acting differently, not being nearly as responsive or wanting to communicate with me, and not putting in as much effort in conversation as she normally does, and I began to worry. Several days go by where we would have one text message exchange between the two of us, and then several days of no communication, which is extremely out of the ordinary. 

March 3rd, she tells me that she isn't well, is being watched by her family, and is suicidal, and that the following day, she's seeing her psychiatrist for treatment/medication. She's been medicated since she was around 16, and isn't a stranger to meds, but hasn't told me anymore about how she's doing or what's going on. I expressed my concern to her early on and that I was proud of her for seeking treatment and having the courage to tell me, and that I would always be here for her and that I'm not going anywhere. She said that she appreciates it and just needs to take things slow, but hasn't done much more past that. Flash forward to now, I haven't been reaching out as much because I don't want to overload her with social interaction since she's anxious about these kinds of things. It's been 5 days since I've heard from her, but she's read my messages via snapchat and didn't reply to them.

To add insult to injury, she works for the school system and with COVID19, she's been stuck at home for the last two weeks, and I'm sure that isn't helping her mental state. She's surrounded by people that care about her, and that's important, but it's also taken out the consistency/schedule she needs to help with her recovery. She isn't checking her phone or making efforts to respond to me, and I understand that depression sucks that energy out of you to do that, but the uncertainty of not knowing how she's doing is worrying me.

Is there anything more that I can do to help? I miss my best friend, but I completely understand that this time she's taking is the most important thing for her recovery. If anyone has been through something similar or could provide me some insight, I'd greatly appreciate it."

The only real choice you can make is how or when you die, most all other things are imposed on you, from birth to other things.

I have considered and researched suicide almost obsessively.

I think we all have two choices, keep living (perhaps and most definitely under not so good conditions) until you are dragged from life forcefully, or decide when you¡¯ve had enough and move on by your own choice.
I prefer the latter, which is why I¡¯ll through my support behind a Right To Die Society.
Death is a mercy very few have the sense to appreciate, one day we all gonna die. What if we choose the date of our death. Modern science is capable of making ways for painless death, but the government doesn't allow it, medical science finds a way to prolong the human lifespan, that is when it will become obvious how evil it is for governments to keep people alive against their will so they can be exploited like farm animals."

suicidewatch,ProximallyBeen,2020/1/3,"The Void and Drive to Escape So recently all I've been able to feel is demotivation, meaninglessness, nothingness and a constant drive for escape. For the past few months I've been unable to do anything but escape, whether that's through YouTube Videos, TV shows, social media or sleep. I've been struggling to manage this, despite it negatively impact all aspects of my life, but because I feel demotivated and life feels meaningless, I can't seem to convince myself to do anything other than escape. Usually my depression and anxiety would kick in, which would push me to do the right thing so I wouldn't have to feel deperessed or anxious anymore, but I don't really feel anything, so my emotional drive is gone. 

If things got really bad I would start to get suicidal thoughts, things are worse than ever before yet my suicidal drive is nowhere to be found. I'm kind of in a position where suicide seems very suitable, if I were in this position 6 months ago, I'd already be dead, but like I said there's no drive to kill myself so I'm not really sure how I'd be able to do it. It feels like I'm going to have to force myself to do it, which I don't want, but at this point it's not really about what I want and more about what I have to do."

It's been 22 years and I am tired of waiting, tired of hoping for a better tomorrow, tired of being called selfish for wanting to leave this world, tired of doing my best and never being enough, tired of feeling dirty, used and unwanted...

suicidewatch,FamilyCanBeAnyone,2020/1/1,"Today is the Date of my Cousins Suicide Alt account, and I hope that this post is allowed here?

I just really needed to say something

On his mother¡¯s birthday, which was coincidently the early hours of New Year¡¯s Day, 2 years ago, my cousin committed suicide. As an only child, my close cousins from my moms side were the closest things I had to siblings and some of my first friends due to shyness. Being the middle, age wise of all of these cousins, I always looked up to my cousin, ¡°N¡±, because he was the outgoing and popular boy that was the exact opposite of childhood me. Feeling forgettable compared to everything he seemed to do, I longed to be more like him as I got older. He became a high school psych and soc. teacher eventually, and actually ¡°inspired¡± me to initially study elementary education, even while I contradicted myself while full well knowing that I didn¡¯t like young kids. Towards the last few years before his death, I learned of and witnessed his alcoholism, to the extreme sometimes. I even managed to admire it somehow, in an immature, very early high school kind of way. The path he was going down really only led one way, his parents and sister had sat him down and talked to him, and he wouldn¡¯t take their offers or advice. Our grandparents did the same i learned. Only after his death did I find out some of the objectively terrible things that he had done as someone truly suffering. As a early 20 year old, and someone who had suffered severe depression and suicidal thoughts for several years in late high-school, I definitely struggle with the emotional baggage and memories that this time of year brings. I am not a risk of suicide myself, after going through a lot of therapy and seeing what a suicide does to people. But I just wanted to share my story and get some invisible thing off my chest. 

I just hope everyone stays safe this season."

suicidewatch,Bandicoot_knight,2020/2/2,"This isn't a support subreddit I came here to find reasons to not commit suicide since my methods of doing so will involve the deaths of thousands of innocent people. I can't fathom killing myself alone and isolated so I often fantasize about getting the cops or the military (an action that would most likely lead to mass murder) to gun me down in a massive shootout. It's kinda the reason why I often contemplate suicide, but could never bring myself to do it because I just can't imagine myself taking another human life as well. My respect for people far exceeds my desire to kill. Because of this, I try to find reasons to continue living on this planet despite my predicament. 

I thought this subreddit would be a good place to do so, yet I see so many people encouraging others to not be afraid to take their own lives. So many comments here and there are just people claiming why suicide is the only option, why it is not selfish, and why existing on this planet is pointless in the grand scheme of things. Any comment that tries to go against the idea of taking one's life - offering platitudes such as ""its a permanent solution to a temporary problem"" is a relatively popular example - is heavily downvoted. I think the only time people are against suicide here is if that particular person has a dog or cat to look after. 

So, why is this sub even considered a support sub? Shouldn't it just be a pro-suicide sub in that case? Because all the posts on here are not trying to discourage people from killing themselves, but merely doing the complete opposite. Personally I think this is a dangerous practice, especially since there are people like me who can't commit suicide unless we kill other people in the process."
suicidewatch,lostkoalas,2020/3/16,"feeling like there's not much for me in the future Growing up, I always bore the weight of heavy expectations from those around me. I was smart - I was supposed to go to an Ivy League, become a doctor, be gorgeous and talented and athletic. I was given all the means to succeed; its no one else's fault but my own that this never happened.

Now, I am painfully mediocre - average GPA, average looking, no talents or passions, not going to get into med school. I burned out in high school and now feel pretty directionless, career-wise. On top of that, I've got a pretty life-altering addiction I can't kick - these things have all majorly factored into the fact that my family is a disaster nowadays. Life looks pretty bleak right now - even if I knew how to live with having let everyone around me down and being average (not a doctor, no other talents, no idea how to move forward in life and in the job field), I cannot keep living with this addiction.

I don't know what to do. All I know is that if I were to die, I would probably make everyone's lives easier - my parents, who obsess over my future, wouldn't invest so much time constantly yelling at me and dealing with comparisons from other parents and they wouldn't have to constantly check in with me to see just how much I've failed them this time. My siblings wouldn't have to deal with the embarrassment of being related to me and they would be able to live in a more peaceful household. I don't really have friends who would care.

We are conducting a paid research study and seeking participants. We received a five-year grant from NIH, we aim to shed light on two core mechanisms involved in a broad range of mental health conditions: reward sensitivity and executive function, as assessed using self-report questionnaires, behavioral tasks, and brain imaging.

We are looking for individuals who have survived an attempt in the past year. While we anticipate the study will help inform future research on treatment, the study itself does not involve or change treatment in any way.

We are interested in recruiting people ages 18-55 who are experiencing difficulties related to their mood or behavior. Past substance abuse is okay if it was over six months ago. The study involves an eligibility phone call (lasting up to 40 minutes), and then 3-4 visits to UC Berkeley (2-3 hours each) for those who are eligible. We pay $30/hour and cover public transportation or parking costs.

If interested, please follow this link to our pre-screen survey:

The only support I get is, unsurprisingly, is from my online friends, but I just recently lost two of the closest people to me due to my stupid actions and everything is just slowly getting worse and worse, regardless if there are good days, the bad and completely neutral days outweigh them. I've attempted suicide in the past, but that obviously didn't work out very well and my mother only treated it as like I had just broke her favorite mug. It was disrespectful of me, I made her look bad, all that jazz. After having my christmas, new years and my birthday ruined for me, I started my downward spiral of ridiculous emotions yet again. I just can't get a break with anything and I'm honestly fed up, and I want to resort to taking my life but in the back of my mind I just feel so guilty and ashamed, because my mother just recently bought our newest house, thatshe's been saving up to for years. And I'm just going to ruin that celebration by killing myself, and god only knows how she'll manage to even pay for the funeral cost because we're going to be pretty much broke once the house is ours. I care too much about my responsibilities to ever take my life, no matter how much I want to. Over the summer, my brother's health declined extremely fast because he's the type of person to be bleeding out right in front of everyone and say he's fine, so I'm the only one left to watch over him since my mother works so many hours, and I'm scared. And I feel helpless. I don't want to leave things as they are. If my mom never bought that house and my brother was in pea health, I would kill myself right now without a second thought, I'd plan everything out and exactly how I want things to be, but I can't. I just can't with all this guilt on me, and it feels awful.

suicidewatch,quark613,2020/2/28,"Poker, Life, and Suicide Let's talk about suicide. In poker when you sit at a table long enough eventually you'll start to tilt, odds are. It's only the idiots who when they're tilting continue to sit at the table, throwing more and more chips into the pot. The people who really know the game understand that when you start to tilt, you cut your loses, get up and walk away from the table. You come back the next day or the next week, when your head is clear. When poker players tilt they become emotional and they stop thinking quite so rationally. The problem is that, maybe the next time you sit down at the table you'll tilt again, and maybe the next time, and eventually you become so frustrated with the game you lose the desire to play the game. In poker as in life there are commonalities: other people are always involved, there's an element of random chance, fortune and misfortune abound, you can try to cheat and lie your way through it, all you have to work with is what you hold, and although there is an element of mastery there is no perfection."

suicidewatch,Organic-Media,2020/2/7,"Happiness is a thing that happen to other people. Since the the age of 16 I've not had  any sort of romantic attention from anyone, throughout high school and  then university I never got so much as one person even seem interested,  anyone I asked out said no.  
The only attention I ever got was  constant bullying, this continued even into collage, its not sex that I  missed out on, its being told ""I love you"" by another human being.  


Throughout  my life it always seemed that romance and relationships were something  that happened to other people, the more I tried and failed the worse I  felt about myself, thus the worse thing became. Online dating never  worked for me, tinder, bumble, hinge nothing but ghosting on the rare  occasion I get so much as a hi back, real life social opportunities are  sparse as I have few friends and even less I can actually meet.

Watching  my friends destroy themselves over and over in toxic relationships in  the past and even now pushed me even further into not seeing the point in relationships and sex isnt even an option.

My career ceased  to be due to losing my job due to my clinical depression,while I know  comparison is the theft of joy seeing my university classmates do so  well and now I'm stuck on welfare the last 3 years, I hate it and  myself.  
When I went to therapy nothing ever seemed to  stick, they gave me ever increasing amounts of medication, my self worth  just kept plummeting,  when I had mirrors before I removed them  I'd  only see a shadow, hobbies that I had once are completely vapid and even  color doesn't seem as bright.  
Last month I turned 30 with nothing to show for it and I've flat out given up, everyone had high hopes and now its over.  
I  don't have a reason to be, let alone a reason to date me and never  blamed women as a whole for any of this, its purely my own fault for  being subhuman.

Now looking back I don't think I've ever truly been happy, suicide seems like the only solution, I'm sick of talking to suicide hotlines."

It feels like wanting to get everything off of your chest but not wanting to go through the effort of even writing this

It feels like being self critical about every single thing you do and erasing and rewriting this every ten words. 

It feels like fantasising about the kind of person you wish you were and knowing full well that it's achievable and that you're just too goddamn lazy and tired to even put in a drop of effort towards realizing that goal

It feels like wishing you never existed

It feels like wanting to take a belt and choke yourself with it but then backing out at the last minute

It feels like comparing yourself to everyone and seeing how they all have their lives together so much more than you do and wondering how they have the energy to do it

It feels like being bored with it all

It feels like eating plain oatmeal for every meal except that feeling applies to everything in your life: movies, books, socializing, hobbies, anything

It feels like waking up and the first thought you have is ""why couldn't I have died from an aneurysm last night?""

It feels like not remembering what it's like to be happy because you have been perpetually depressed your entire life

It feels like wanting to reach out for help but knowing that you go through these episodes too often and you would be a shitty friend to dump all of this on anyone

It feels like you're invisible

It feels like having to block out the voice in your head telling you about all of your anxieties because of you even try to plan anything you'll start having a panic attack

It feels like having solace in knowing that if you cry that's a good thing because it means that at least you aren't completely numb to everything

suicidewatch,serenekylene,2020/3/10,"I want to end my life at 20 years old There is nothing further for me to experience, no reason to continue living. On the surface, I have an ideal life. I am a 20 year old caucasian woman. Born to a wealthy family in a Westernized country, I was given every educational and recreational opportunity that one could desire. I have above-average physical attractiveness, which helps to compensate for my abysmal personality.

However, I have already squandered most of the advantages that I was born with. I chose a useless major when I entered college, and I am attempting to transfer in to my university's nursing program as a last-minute hail-Mary. There is no guarantee that I will get in, and if I don't, I would have wasted approximately $100,000 of my parents tuition money on a fucking *liberal arts*degree. My GPA is projected to drop to a meager 3.1 by the end of the semester, given the fact that I got a C on a midterm and multiple F's on reading pop quizzes. Even in the pre-nursing classes where I am motivated to work hard, I can barely scrape by with a B after hours of dedicated study time. I have aspirations to become a nurse anesthetist, but that dream is becoming increasingly unlikely due to my academic incompetence.

I despise myself so deeply that I often fantasize about hanging myself in my dorm room or throwing myself off of a building. Throughout my adolescence and young adulthood, I often wished that I could replace my soul with a perfect, emotionless automaton who got A's on every exam, ran marathons, collected a litany of accolades, and secured a high-paying white collar job. Just a placeholder who would make my parents proud so that they could boast to their country-club friends.

I will probably be a drain on society in the future, so I might as well end it all now. I cannot picture any amount of success in my future, despite my incredibly privileged upbringing. Family and friends have told me that I am a 7-8/10 on the scale of physical beauty, but all of my attempts at flirtation have been rejected.

Whenever I see successful individuals (doctors, lawyers, engineers, CEO's, programmers, scientists), I always feel sick to my stomach, despite the fact that these people are primarily responsible for economic and technological progression. I cannot live with my mediocrity anymore. I don't even think that I could marry someone who was more financially successful than me, even if it would be in my best interest to do so. My nonexistent self esteem simply couldn't handle it.

Lately this has been on my mind a lot and giving me anxiety.

My roommates were sitting me down and telling me about how they were worried about my irrational thought process but to me, I want my life to constantly go up with a few bumps here and there, but overall I don't want to spend time figuring out how to get out of a hole that's been dug too deep.

To me, the hardest thing I've had to face was a hard exam and it scares me knowing that I'll have to deal with more than that in the future. I'm okay with relationship problems and stuff like that but I don't want to run into things like being permanently disabled (having something amputated, losing your eyesight, paraplegia,etc.), being poor/homeless, getting disfigured, getting cancer, etc.

I have vowed to kill myself if I ever run into these issues because I don't want to have to deal with figuring out how to get out of that hole, unless I predict it to be an easy battle. I know happiness will eventually adjust and you will live with whatever life throws at you but I don't want to have to live with something I consider debilitating even if I eventually somewhat recover.

 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Thought 2: What if depression is the result of a lack of reward feeling in the brain? Since so many associations get made daily, every minute, second of our life ¨C what used the be a reward, could quite possibly have become so ¡°dirtied¡± with other connections (guilt, etc) that the result, a source of energy for the brain, has gone missing. And this can happen up till a point before it completely reduces functionality.

&amp;#x200B;

So therefor, a list, of often naturally inherent rewards ¨C that might not have gotten 'spoiled' yet and will fuel me with an energy for living. Kind of how cutting yourself also feels good, but then ¡®less destructive¡¯, I guess. Important is to take your time and become aware of your body/minds reaction to it. Don¡¯t rush into something else afterwards. Maybe think of it as a way to recalibrate your mind into lowering its threshold for rewards by experiencing deeply some more ¡®basic¡¯ ones. 

&amp;#x200B;

¡¤ Crawl under a blanket, head also covered, remain there. Breath and sleep or relax up until the point that you crave some fresh air, wait a bit past that, then expose your head to breathe ¨C a feeling that is now very obviously satisfying, so fresh. A reward that is always there, but has simply been taken for granted

¡¤ This can also be done in water, in a bath/whatever ¨C relax under water until the need for air arises, wait as much as you can, then emerge. Try to really take the time to notice the feeling, instead of rushing into something else before its over: grabbing a towel, starting to laugh, ¡­

¡¤ Hold your pee, and enjoy the sensation of release when you do finally go to the toilet. Don¡¯t rush it, don¡¯t rush to wipe, just sit there calmly a while after.

(Don¡¯t hold your poo, doesn¡¯t work the same, rather go instantly when you get the sensation ¨C don¡¯t focus too much on the release since poo is too associated with disgust)

¡¤ Let yourself grow hungry yet only have healthy food in the fridge ¨C vegetables, fruit, .. Eat when you really have to, not a craving for tasty food, but when you actually ache for ¨¢ny type of food. When eating, don¡¯t rush, ruminate profoundly on every bite, focus on your saliva coming in and making it easier, take a deep breath in when you can¡¯t ruminate on it any longer, and swallow. take a nice exhale out ¨C and relax. Sit still for a moment after each bite, let your mind take in any ¡®invisible rewards¡¯. 

¡¤ When cold, try pushing through the cold for a while. It might pass, making you a fraction mentally stronger, or you might reach a maximum ¨C if possible, sit with your back against a heater, but beforehand, try and remove some other sensations (swallow your food, close your eyes, .. whatever is possible) ¨C Fully engage to the source of warmth, and again, relax and try to fully take in the satisfaction from it. Even when it seems to have passed, remain abit longer (just as with the suffering) Perhaps suffering longer makes the reward just a tad bit better, right?

(This can also be set up, make your environment so that you¡¯ll get cold, and prepare your source of warmth)

&amp;#x200B;

With everything, try to absolutely minimalize the possible associations that could happen between these, lets call them ¡°reflex-rewards¡±. If the blanket smells like your ex, use another one ¨C If another sensation gets your attention: a smell, noise, visual distractions, you name it, always try to reduce them.

suicidewatch,Throwaway62630591,2020/4/8,"Intrusive suicidal thoughts I never thought it would come as far as writing this and posting it online, but here I am.

So since I was 10 or something, I have been quite severely depressed, probably because of many quite intense things happening to me over the course of 10 years (10-20yrs old) including but not limited to being bullied and a social outcast, having bad family relations, being groomed, raped and groped by many men, some strangers and some whom I have known and trusted. I felt worthless a lot of the time, but after taking magic truffles I felt the motivation to turn my life around and I actually ended up where I feel like I belong, following my passion of music at the conservatory. Last year I got a taste of genuine happiness, I was a straight A student and for the first time in my life I actually became quite popular.

Unfortunately, this year many depressing thoughts have come back again, due to some more traumatising experiences including a toxic relationship and losing my best friend/soulmate to drugs. My main subject teacher at the conservatory didn't really acknowledge my feelings and basically said he didn't care for them and just cared about my results which weren't great at the time, so I started struggling a lot with insecurity and feeling worthless again, like I was weak for not just sucking it up. For my theory subjects my grades were fine (although not as good as last year), so my teachers also told me they saw no need to help me. 

Now main subject is fine, and I perform fine at school, so on the surface I have nothing to complain about: my family life has been good for a few years now, I have many friends who genuinely care about me, my performance in school is sufficient and I am dating someone I feel is even out of my league.
But I can't help but feel suicidal a lot of the time, it's like intrusive thoughts, I can just be doing anything feeling fine and then very suddenly, it's like a switch is flipped and all I can think is ""I want to sink a knife into my throat, I want to blow my brains out, I deserve to have my limbs cut off"". The moment this happens I can't stop thinking about it anymore and I feel it in every fiber of my being, like it gives me a certain kind of energy that can only be released if I hurt myself. 

I have developed a bit of a (temporary) aversion to psychedelics due to a bad experience I had (set and setting were not ideal, to say the least). If this was not the case, I might have tried it again to see things from another perspective, but that idea is out of the picture now. I'm starting therapy but it will be a very long process for me because my traumas are so complex. The only thing that seems to distract me from wanting to die is approval of men, which of course is a very unhealthy coping mechanism. When the guy I am dating took a break from social media I felt like I was going crazy, there are some other guys on the side that I can get attention from but it is like it's never enough. I don't want those relationships to get too serious as well, because I don't want to hurt their feelings just to get my fix of distraction, and I want to eventually develop my relationship further with the one I am dating with. But yeah, my issues are so deep-rooted that it's like I'm hardwired to cope in this way now.
I also sleep a lot, I love dreaming of romance with a guy that is unattainable in real life, maybe because it gives me a sense of security knowing that I can always dream and never dare, without being hurt.

I don't really know what I'm trying to do here because I know there is no clear-cut answer to my actual question (wtf do I do?). I feel like I will actually kill myself if I don't do anything to battle my thoughts turning against me, but I feel like I can't find any distraction other than talking to thirsty guys. Just anything that's a bit more healthy to combat these intrusive thoughts until therapy starts will help me a lot, maybe mental exercises or something."

i hate my job, and i always feel incompetent for doing it, i see myself physically unable to do it and feel myself am not qualified to worth it though it's paying little, and there is no option for promotion or salary raise, but it's still the only option of job i have. 
i always see myself less than a man, because i don't see any qualities of a man in me, and i feel uncomfortable when people call me that or use polite names with me like Sir or Mister.
girls used to get along with me because of my humor but i never used that to get intimate with any of them, because when i do i feel like am fooling them pretending to be someone that i am not, so i refrain and take a step back.
sometimes looking at a girl down street is enough to bring me to tears. 
i am afraid that my illness would start to show up in this age and my life gets even worse. 
my illness was always overwhelming preventing me from living like everyone else, in my childhood i didn't have fun like other kids because playing outside could be harmful for me. 
when i grew up my friends used to make fun of me saying that i am too nice.
i write this with tears in my eyes triggered by the words i type. 
i can't take my own life because of my beliefs or maybe just because i am a cowered, am not sure which one is holding me back. 
but i pray every single day to die soon and i never stop praying all day long, for me it doesn't matter how it's gonna happen, an accident or a fatal illness or wherever, i pray for God to choose whatever he wants to curse me with just to take my life right away.
i don't know if this is just a depression period that will pass, but this depression was taking over me for a year now since i started working in this job."

ptsd,railcow,2020/4/19,"Anti-anxiety medication prescriptions have spiked 34% during the coronavirus pandemic Americans are also filling more prescriptions for antidepressants and anti-insomnia drugs. 

The coronavirus is taking a toll on mental health.

The number of prescriptions for antidepressant, anti-anxiety and anti-insomnia medications filled per week increased 21% between Feb. 16 and March 15, 2020, according to a new report by Express Scripts, a Cigna-owned US:CI pharmacy benefit manager. The study analyzed prescription claims filled between Jan. 19 and March 15 of this year among a sample of more than 31.5 million commercially-insured individuals, and found that claims peaked during the week ending March 15, when the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was declared a pandemic.

Anti-anxiety drugs saw the biggest spike, jumping 34.1%, which was more than double the number of insomnia aids (14.8%), and almost twice as high as antidepressants (18.6%).

Express Scripts noted that this is a sharp u-turn from the 12.1% decline in the use of anti-anxiety meds like Pfizer¡¯s US:PFE Xanax and Roche¡¯s US:RHHBY Valium that it recorded between 2015 and 2019, as well as the 11.3% decline in the use of anti-insomnia meds during that same window.

¡°This analysis, showing that many Americans are turning to medications for relief, demonstrates the serious impact COVID-19 may be having on our nation¡¯s mental health,¡± the report concluded.

It¡¯s the latest in a series of recent warnings about the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on the public¡¯s psychological health.

More than 4 in 10 Americans are feeling lonelier now than ever before as a result of social distancing during the coronavirus outbreak, according to a survey of 1,055 people commissioned by the University of Phoenix published this week. More than one in five people (22%) also say their sleep quality has suffered since the coronavirus spread. Recent findings from the Axios/Ipsos Coronavirus Index also revealed that some 35% of Americans said their mental health had worsened during the pandemic, and 43% said their emotional well-being had also gotten worse.

That¡¯s not surprising considering more than 20 million Americans are out of work as non-essential businesses have temporarily closed, and COVID-19 cases have surpassed more than 2 million worldwide, with more than 137,000 deaths and climbing (although more than 525,000 have also recovered.)

America was already in the grip of a loneliness epidemic and a mental health crisis even before the COVID-19 outbreak hit. Almost one in five U.S. adults reported experiencing a mental health condition in 2018, and the teen suicide rate climbed more than 50% over the past decade. Mental health conditions cost the health care system more than $200 billion a year, making it one of the country¡¯s most expensive health conditions. They also lead to more than $193 billion in lost earnings per year.

&gt; 
&gt; The diagnostic criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been reformulated and narrowed for ICD-11 [1] to six core symptoms across the clusters re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal.  In comparison,  PTSD criteria in  DSM-IV  consist of sixteen symptoms across three clusters, in DSM-5 of twenty symptoms across four clusters,  and in  ICD-10  of thirteen symptoms across three clusters. 
&gt; 
&gt; The new ICD-11 diagnosis Complex PTSD (CPTSD) requires symptoms of PTSD and in addition disturbances of self-organization: affect dysregulation, negative self-concept, and interpersonal problems. Impairment represented in the disturbances of self-organization domains is not necessarily associated with trauma-related stimuli.  CPTSD  typically follows prolonged or multiple events, but diagnosis does not require a certain type and frequency of a traumatic event...

&gt;.
&gt;.
&gt;**In conclusion, the current  findings indicate that the  ICD-11 PTSD criteria are less sensitive than other diagnostic manuals and may not, therefore, identify all traumatized and impaired young people with high psychological distress. This might lead to restricted access to eligible treatment for some young people since ICD is mainly used in clinical practice. ICD-11 does not as yet provide developmentally  sensitive adaptations or wording of PTSD and CPTSD criteria, and this topic needs to be discussed critically. Furthermore, differences between diagnostic manuals  might lead to limited comparability of treatment studies and to reduced relevance of research for practitioners.**

ptsd,Twinflametruth,2020/2/14,"A PTSD ¡°CURE¡± THAT COULD LEAD YOU INTO A CULT?! A WARNING ABOUT ¡°the mind alignment process¡± by Jeff and Shaleia led by Christine Kay. Hi everyone, I¡¯m new here but I have and understand ptsd and even c-ptsd.

I have been very vocal in other places but there is currently a group of people that are doing an experimental psychotherapy on people called MAP, or the ¡°Mind Alignment Process¡± ( mindalignmentprocess.org ) 

This site and group, led by cult leaders Jeff and Shaleia and army sergeant christine Kay makes all these claims of being able to cure trauma and cure anxiety, ptsd and more with just a few sessions. Take a look at their site for the grandiose claims- I have screenshots of it all as well. 

I wanted to let you know that it doesn¡¯t cure ptsd and that it¡¯s actually a very dangerous psychological experiment that is essentially being led by a few business psychopath cult leaders and Chrissy who is also not a medical doctor and who¡¯s background is in public chemical safety and business?!

I won¡¯t go into it all here, but I¡¯d suggest that if anyone from this MAP group contacts you that you do not get a session with them. The process involves getting into a deep state of hypnosis and then, once you¡¯ve worked through memories you are implanted with belief systems and essentially brainwashed.

What can happen after a map session is actually your memory and cognitive function to be impaired and it can leave some people suicidal- one of their students committed suicide last year. Or you end up joining a cult because of whatever placebo effects you feel. 

As for the suicide- they hushed it up and never made any kind of post even though you can clearly see in weeks prior that she had posted in their group for emotional support and when she said she had ptsd, she was referred to a whack job twin flame coach instead of seeing a professional therapist and doctor. This group is not safe, and have even gone as far to black mail people who wrote about them including a cult expert who weighed in on the recent vice Canada article, calling twin flames universe a cult. 

Vice article here: https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/v747x4/this-youtube-school-promised-true-love-students-say-they-got-exploited-instead

Jeff has stated in video multiple times that he sees map as a pipeline to bring people into his twin flame cult, twin flames universe, and or to his classes life purpose class or twin flame ascension school. 

They also coerce their students to become mostly free employees and have done things like heteronormative gender assignments and told people who their twin flame is and even told a few to violate restraining orders.

ptsd,kfaddler,2020/4/6,"Why Reaching Out to Individuals who Suffer From Mental Illness is so Crucial  

The effects of quarantine  for an individual suffering from mental illness or chronic illness could be devastating.

 The isolation, change in routine, lack of structure, loss of social  connection, maybe the loss of a job, the economic pressure are things we  are all facing right now. The fear and terror is being shoved down our  throats at every turn. However, these can be huge triggers for  individuals with mental illness. The stress can also be triggers for  those with chronic illness. Now, more than ever your friends and family may need you to reach in. Send a text, make a call- form a connection. 

If you want to help your loved ones who are struggling with mental illness- Reach In

 ¡°Some days when symptoms are high, it can be complete paralysis.  Getting out of bed alone may feel totally impossible and when it¡¯s  finally achieved it might be a huge accomplishment. Leaving us  completely drained and any social interaction feeling like pure torture,  especially if we have to initiate it. When self criticism and self  doubt are that high, feeling like a burden and reaching out seems  absolutely ridiculous and completely rude and totally out of the  question. It may feel like standing in front of a class naked giving a  presentation. Imagine your head rapidly swirling with every negative and  toxic thing anyone has ever said to you, while having bricks around  your feet. ¡°

ptsd,obsidiandestiny,2020/3/23,"Good days and bad days and chronic fatigue I have a hard time letting myself accept the diagnosis of PTSD because I've always heard the, 'other people have it worse than you' in response to my trauma. I don't consider it 'bad enough' to allow myself to be associated with those who have 'actual trauma', especially on my good days when I don't have panic attacks or can go to the store with minimal hyperawareness. But then on my bad days when I have multiple panic attacks because people stand too close to me, I can understand how the diagnosis makes sense. And then there's the chronic fatigue, making it hard to anything other than drag myself, exhausted, to the bathroom where I look at my haggard appearance in the mirror and feel guilty that a shower seems so taxing that I can't even fathom having one. Because of my symptoms, I don't necessarily deny having PTSD... It's just difficult to say I have it when my experiences are nothing compared to someone else's."

ptsd,sporglorg,2020/4/5,"A discussion about online/Zoom therapy Hello everyone

I'm a psychology researcher as well as someone who sees a therapist and has recently transitioned to remote therapy sessions because of COVID-19.

As I'm sure we all know, telemental health¡ª namely, live therapy sessions through technology/services like Zoom ¡ª has been on the rise in recent years, but is currently spiking because of COVID-19 and the need for everyone to stay indoors.

Many therapists are adapting quickly and transitioning to remote sessions via apps like Zoom, including my own therapist. This is fantastic and is working for a lot of people, but, as I'm sure other patients and therapists on this sub are experiencing, many important parts of our usual therapy is getting left behind at the office.

For example, my therapist and I usually make use of an Oculus VR headset or actual physical objects/things for my exposure therapy. Now, we have to do things verbally or by sending links of images/videos. Additionally, my therapist usually gets a close-quarters view of my reaction and state of anxiety during our sessions, but this is significantly more difficult over video call (webcam quality, lag, etc.)

If you're a therapist, I'd really appreciate it if you could fill out my survey: https://forms.gle/SkY9jkz7K8vBfkWs8. I'd love to understand this problem from your perspectives. This might turn into a research project at a later stage, but your answers from this survey won't be included there. My apologies if links aren't allowed here.

Otherwise, looking forward to discussing this with everyone and hearing your thoughts &amp; experiences so far :)."

Study it hard.

&amp;#x200B;

The more you study the nature of malevolence - that's its something which has always been present part of the world - only then can you get out of this hell - because what caused you to enter it was not just your encounter with evil but also your naivety that evil doesn't really exist.

ptsd,Lady_rotkaeppchen,2020/1/11,"PTSD symptoms reappearing after months of complete freedom I was sexually assaulted on a date in November of my freshman year of college, which was just over a year ago. I didn't remember the incident until February of freshman year, which was when my PTSD symptoms began to appear and worsen, which caused the deterioration and end of my first serious relationship. I was diagnosed in July when I began trauma therapy and attended weekly until mid-November of this year, when my therapist and I jointly decided I no longer needed to continue attending, since I had seemed to make a dramatic recovery and had not experienced any symptoms for several weeks. 

I'm not quite sure how I recovered so quickly, but I developed good coping and grounding skills in therapy and also have a wonderful, supporting and loving boyfriend who doesn't judge me or blame me for my symptoms, unlike my previously mentioned ex. After months of near daily panic attacks, nightmares and insomnia, and constant anxiety, I came to a point where I felt completely and utterly free. I felt like I had my life back and started to no longer see myself as a victim of assault, but a survivor. I didn't feel stuck in the past anymore, and for the first time in nearly a year, I was able to be excited about the future as opposed to only focused on how to survive each day. 

But for some reason over the past few weeks, I've started to experience some symptoms again. Not nearly to the degree they used to be, but they're there. I think it's worsened by the fact that I can't help but feeling defeated and disappointed in myself that this has started up again. My wonderful boyfriend keeps telling me that he loves me no matter what and that it's not my fault and that beating myself up for the reappearance is only going to make it worse, and he's right, but I can't help being terrified that this is going to escalate. I'm so scared I'm going to lose all the progress I've made. Has anyone else experienced anything like this?

After recently completing some group cbt and putting a year into focusing on improving myself I got the courage to start applying for jobs again, and I found what seemed like the perfect place.

So now I'm working as a line cook for a cute little breakfast place called Angelique's which at first was so supportive and the work was fun and exciting, but now has become the place I dread going to more than anything. After only a month and a half of me working here our expo chef quit, another line cook quit, and the head chef decided to bring his little brother on as the new expo chef. Unfortunately the head chefs younger brother seems to struggle with his responsibilities and since the day he started has shirked those responsibilities on to me and my fellow cooks. Not only does he not put any consideration into what would make other people's lives easier, he specifically goes out of his way to act petty and rude to the entirety of the staff. And the cherry on top, hes a fucking pervert and tries to force me into these uncomfortable, sexually charged ""jokes"" every day belittling every female he sees by treating them less than human.
This past week has really seemed like hes kicked his fuckery into 5th gear, hes decided to no longer speak to me but instead point at things he wants me to do, he berates the waitresses and the dishwashers, and he fights with everyone working line with him. Of course today him and his brother, the head fucking chef, showed up high on speed pills and sat there and stuffed their faces with food as myself and another cook struggled through service.
The owner sides with the head chef no matter what and cant afford to jeopardize their relationship so he will never discipline him or his brother out of fear theyre going to quit. If anyone has any advice on how to reasonably deal with this and to not fall victim to the boiling rage that this is causing me I would love you for ever.  Sorry for the rant love you guys"

ptsd,harrassedbytherapist,2020/3/12,"New Hope! A ""Largely Unexplored"" Brain Region Shows Link of Chronic Stress to Physical Symptoms for the First Time I just saw this write-up and thought ""this is the most hopeful thing we and those with other chronic stress disorders have in neuro treatments."" The is hope for us to stay on top of our skills and in routines, but it is a lot of work for what are brain changes that do things to us that we just can't do much except treat ourselves as if we are sick for. So reading something like this for me - especially after a few weeks of being on the lesser-functioning side - was truly uplifting.

the below was taken from ""Inverse;"" study published in the extremely highly-regarded ""Science"":

In this study, Nakamura and his team tried to answer a basic question about our fight-or-flight response. Where do these physical symptoms of stress come from in the brain? And can they be controlled?

To do this, the team injected rats with a tracer that would allow them to see which areas of their brains activated in response to social stress. For rats, that means that they were exposed to chronic social defeat (essentially rat-bullying, which stresses them out).

After sustained social rejection, neurons in two specific regions of the rats' brains caught the team's attention: the dorsal peduncular cortex and the dorsal tenia tecta. The latter is largely ""unexplored,"" the researchers say.

When rats are continuously rejected by their peers, they also exhibit physical responses, including increases in blood pressure, or heart rate. But when the team injected the rats with a drug that stopped the neurons from firing, heart rate decreased by 53 percent and blood pressure plummeted by 77 percent.

The dorsal tenia tecta ""has not been focused by research so far,"" so how these neurons function was ""totally unknown,"" Nakamura says. Importantly, these changes don't appear to affect the body's heart beat or temperature overall, which suggests this circuit is solely responsible for the physical toll of stress."

Tonight I worked through the flashbacks from my previous triggering relationship and told my partner that I wasn¡¯t sure how long I could hold onto our relationship if he was going to continue to temporarily alleviate stress by smoking marijuana or drinking.

ptsd,slebsta,2020/3/8,"Does post traumatic stress disorder ever really go away? So I was diagnosed with PTSD after my best friend was murdered almost four years ago. My friend was like my rock at the time, they had the most calming presence, wisdom far beyond their years, the best sense of humor, and the most compassionate heart. We spent large amounts of time together as we grew up and although my PTSD has made many of the memories we had together fuzzy, my time with them was one of the greatest joys I¡¯ll ever have and I will cherish them forever. 

The loss of my closest friend and the brutality of what happened shattered my life at the time. Afterwards I attempted suicide, overdosed, just started spiraling in every way. It is obviously not a ever going to be a super comfortable topic to talk about and I felt selfish at first for reacting the way that I did to this loss of my friend, but with time, EMDR, and therapy, coping with PTSD and grief has become less and less painful and I am now able to drive past where my friend was found, be open about it with close loved ones, go out in public without constant fear of being murdered, not have panic attacks every day, etc. My life has been actually really wonderful within the past two years, after my OD I quit everything cold turkey, got therapy, and started to return to myself, or rather an evolved version of my best self (I don¡¯t think you ever go back to your ¡°old self¡± after a traumatic event) and I am quite thankful and happy to be alive and well and with the people I love most. I still miss my friend every day and I think of them very often, but I have a more thankful outlook on the amazing times we had instead of feeling robbed of what could have been and numb.

Despite this though, the one part of my post traumatic stress that still creeps into my life is the nightmares. Every once in a while I will get these horrific detailed flashbacks or I will have dreams that I can sense are about the death of my friend and every time they happen I wake up having a panic attack. They happened a lot after I sobered up, started actually dreaming again and began confronting my grief but the nightmares gradually got better, especially after EMDR. Yet I still get these nightmares every so often. I actually had one two nights ago and have since avoided sleep because it was one of the worst ones I have had in a long time. 

When does PTSD go away, if ever? It no longer controls my life as it once did but every once in a while it creeps back in, like with these nightmares, and I just want them to stop."

I want it to be realistic and avoid the ""antagonist is violent/criminal because of mental illness"" cliche. Here's a breakdown of the characters' dynamic:

The protagonist secretly has ""headmates"". Because this psychological trait is superficially similar to Dissociative Identity Disorder, the protagonist would experience the same stigmas &amp; discrimination applied to DID if her secret got out.

The antagonist's PTSD/PTSS stems from a mall bombing in which his boyfriend, who suffered from DID, was killed. The protagonist and antagonist went out for a friendly coffee date. The protagonist dropped a hint about her secret to test how her friend might react, which reminded him of his boyfriend and the bombing.

ptsd,jungotim,2020/4/8,"I think I might have mild PTSD? [TW: Depression, related conditions] Over 2 years ago now, on the morning of march 2nd 2018, I threw myself off of an overpass in what is quite possibly my most severe suicide attempt to date. I fell 20-30ish feet, broke my wrist, got 3 compression fractures in my back, and a pretty nasty bump on the forehead, although no concussion. I noticed effects from this almost immediately, in the following weeks I spent in the hospital and psych ward, the slightest things would make me nearly jump out of my skin. During the times we went to the gym, anything moving through the air even remotely in my direction terrified me. I suggested to another patient I had become acquainted with that I thought I might have PTSD, and they just sort of brushed it off. I suppose when they did. I did too, because it wasn't until several months ago that I even reconsidered the idea of having it. Throughout the following couple of years I noticed other things, objects falling over in general, especially if accidentally knocked by me, seem to shake me to my core, to the point where I need to take a few seconds just to breathe and calm down afterwards. On at least 1 occasion I can think of a situation where I had a major flashback type deal, I was listening to some music, on the radio I think, and at the end a song faded out in a particular way that made me think of some of the songs I listened to back when I felt so far gone. The kind of music I listened to while writing my suicide note. Other occasions sometimes remind me of certain aspects of the incident and the lead up to it, enough to spark a general feeling of anxiety and unease, and sometimes, I just think about these things unprompted, leading to the same type of feeling. Some other pieces of content directly related to the event muster up the same emotions. Pictures taken then, messages exchanged, and especially, the songs I mentioned earlier. Since then I've had multiple other brushes with suicidal ideation and attempts, and the songs from then have made their return along with a few others. A particularly rough afternoon has led me to listen to said songs as I write this, which prompted the old feelings of dread, I'd been considering posting about this before but never really knew the place, or just didn't want to end up dealing with it. I've been on antidepressants since before it all happened, and on a few other drugs as well, which, especially now seem to be pretty good at keeping the depression at bay. It wasn't until less than a month ago that I confronted my biggest standing issue with the events, which had been my mother's reaction. I maintain, to this day, that there's nothing worse than making someone who loves and cares so much about you so sad. Even thinking about it now, having confirmation and closure on the issue, it still makes me tear up. I feel like this is getting a bit ramble-y, so I'm just going to quit while I'm ahead.

ptsd,unfurli,2020/4/8,"TRE - Trauma Release Exercises I¡¯ve been advised to practice TRE daily. I¡¯d love to hear from anyone who has benefited from these exercises... need some fuel for my commitment to the practice! 

For those that are wondering what TRE is, it¡¯s a set of simple exercises that induce involuntary tremors in our body, especially the psoas muscles. They were designed by Dr David Berceli and based on Dr Peter Levine¡¯s research into how animals recover from trauma - he had found that wild animals recover from trauma by tremoring spasms of their body core and flailing of limbs, to complete the fight-flight they were in before they froze. Here¡¯s a bit more info on that background

 https://www.acesconnection.com/blog/what-is-trauma-release-exercises-tre

And here¡¯s the main TRE webpage 

https://traumaprevention.com

I¡¯m so curious to hear from anyone who has given this practice a good go and experienced it¡¯s benefits (or not) and to hear details on your experience like how much did you practice, did you do a workshop or get some sessions with a teacher or did you teach yourself and if so did you learn all the 7 steps or just use the basic TRE tremor induced by the position that strains your leg/hip, did you notice physical benefits like decreased chronic muscle pain or more mental/emotional benefits etc? 

I feel like there are so many things I would like to practice daily and we can¡¯t commit to them all so I guess I¡¯m just wanting to hear directly from others if this has helped them so I can know what healing my efforts could bring :)"
ptsd,PennyArturo17,2020/3/20,"Anyone else feel like because of current events, their loved ones can finally better understand their PTSD? I felt like my trauma was sudden and very ""out of left field"" for me-- not something I thought would ever happen to me until it did.  PTSD has haunted me for the past 10 years with the fear of knowing how your whole life can change suddenly and without notice (for the worse), sometimes by things you didn't even think to worry about happening. Years later, even in times of good fortune, I still find myself ""looking over my shoulder"" or ""waiting for the other shoe to drop"". After therapy, I have finally learned how to be a happier me, but I still can't shake this feeling. Sometimes it's not even a concrete thing I'm worried about happening, it's just the general idea that one day you can just wake up and everything about your circumstance has changed, totally out of your control. 

Well... not that I am necessarily ""happy"" about this... but I feel like this global pandemic and the dramatic changes it is making in everyone's lives (at least in the short term), is giving me the words and example necessary to finally communicate to my loved ones what I have been feeling. Many had never given much thought to worrying about a global pandemic seriously threatening their livelihood, and then BOOM. If you had said mid-last-year that you were worried about multiple country-wide lockdowns and severe economic issues due to a global pandemic, people would probably tell you that out of everything you could be worried about, that is probably not a very likely one to pick. Even I would have said that. But then it happens and here you are, and now moving forward I am guessing we will collectively be more worried about pandemic than we were before. And even if you know it's not ""helpful"" to speculate on what bad events could change everything, that doesn't make it easy to shake from your mind that's grasping at straws to ""protect you next time"". 

Anyone else relate to this? Anyone else strangely (and sadly) finding the recent current events as sort of a bridge to loved ones understanding them?"
ptsd,throwawayy287,2020/2/17,"Those of you with sexual trauma who are unable to have casual sex, how do you stay connected to your sexuality/accept that?  I'm just really, really struggling at the moment with how fraught my relationship with sex is due to trauma. It's near impossible for me to feel safe &amp; connected during sexual situations or at this point, even just thinking about sex.

Realistically it seems that the only way I will be able to gradually build a healthy sexual relationship in which I have the capacity to feel safe, connected &amp; embodied will be within the context of building an emotionally close romantic partnership with someone I feel strong romantic feeling for, am (at least at times) very attracted to, connect with well, and who is happy to understand my trauma and take things very slow.

But that sort of relationship is hard to find and build (especially having lots of attachment issues), and I feel so much sadness, fear &amp; frustration around the fact that I don't seem able to explore my sexuality outside of that context because attempting to do so is triggering 90% of the time. I feel so out of touch with my sexuality and I just don't know how to a) accept that this is where I am, and b) navigate this.

ptsd,realsheeps,2020/2/8,"Being interrupted I can't tell if i'm being oversensitive to this or not, now that I've picked up on it being very triggering.

It seems like whenever I start telling a story, even if I'm really, really into it, I get interrupted by the person I'm talking to about something completely unrelated, as if I wasn't even talking in the first place. I talk quietly, usually, but once I start in on a story, I become more animated and try to be engaging. It still happens literally almost every time. Nobody cares when I open my mouth.

This has happened throughout my childhood dealing with parents that were not abusive but were very narcissistic, and continued throughout school, because I learned from my parents that I was uninteresting. I got into a very abusive relationship after high school and he absolutely never let me tell stories because he just hated to hear me talk for a long time, it made him mad, so I stopped talking.

Now, two-ish years after the relationship, I've worked on myself a lot and have gotten over a lot of things, and feel much more confident and capable as a person, but I still cannot seem to get people interested in me. It physically hurts every time they interrupt me, because even though 100% of the time, it's not malicious and it's just them being excited about something else, but my brain takes it as them possibly being mad that I'm still talking, them being totally uninterested in what I have to say, or whatever. It's humiliating and anxiety-provoking on a really deep level and I have to drag myself out of the mental pit I fall in in order to not dissociate for the next few hours.

Is this something that happens to anyone else? Do you have advice?"

ptsd,dfghhjjttffffhhffddr,2020/1/30,"A reading list on trauma Hello,

I¡¯m the past few months I¡¯ve been diagnosed with PTSD and am currently in therapy to overcome some deep personal wounds. I thought I would share a reading list of books that have helped me through it so far. I¡¯m still processing and uncovering everything that happened to me, but hopefully these will help those who are also brave enough to dig deep into their own painful pasts. It can all be overcome.

I would say that while some of these books have a very specific topic, anyone suffering from any sort of unresolved trauma will get something out of them, as they often share similar themes and language.

This is not presented as an exhaustive list, so please fell free to add your own if you think anything is missing.

 - The Unsayable by Annie G. Rogers, Ph.D - helps to demonstrate how trauma hides itself in our language and behaviours, often in deeply unconscious ways, and how unresolved traumatic feelings can be transmitted and inherited over multiple generations.

 - Scared Selfless by Michelle Stevens - a harrowing recollection of the author¡¯s childhood sexual abuse, and how it ultimately lead to a diagnosis of Dissociative Identity Disorder later in life. An astonishing read.

 - Trauma and Memory by Peter A. Levine - goes into the nature of memory recollection and how it relates to healing unresolved trauma.

 - Waking The Tiger by Peter A. Levine - encourages a primal, somatic view of unrecovering and healing unresolved trauma.

 - The Body Keeps The Score by Bessel Van Dee Kolk - the holy bible of unresolved trauma and cptsd in some circles. If you read just one book, read this one.

 - Complex PTSD - From Surviving To Thriving by Pete Walker - goes into the thinking and theory behind a complex ptsd diagnosis and how to heal from it.

 - The Courage to Heal by Ellen Bass and Laura Davis - Geared mainly toward female survivors of childhood sexual abuse.

 - Victims No Longer by Mike Lew - essentially the Male equivalent of the previous book.

 - Children of Trauma by Jane Middleton-Moz - talks about the general effects of early childhood trauma on a persons development through life. Easy to read and highly recommended.

 - Secret Survivors by Sue Blume - geared mainly toward female survivors of incest.

 - It Didn¡¯t Start With You by Mark Wolynn - focuses on multi-generational trauma and how descendants can unconsciously inherit unresolved feelings from previous generations without ever knowing it."

ptsd,Britmccar,2020/1/21,"Survivors of Murder-Suicide Hi all,

On Jan. 30, 2018 I became a survivor of murder-suicide.

Facts were written in the media, case files, autopsy reports and death certificates. They were illustrated with crime scene photos and national news headlines.

Breadcrumbs of truth built the narrative for me, never telling the full story.

There are 11 murder-suicides each week in the United States, often in military and veteran communities. Why aren¡¯t we talking about this publicly beyond sensationalized headlines that don¡¯t help solve the problem?

The lack of support, information, and humanization led me to believe nobody *should* be talking about it. I felt voiceless and carried significant guilt and shame because of the stigmatized circumstances.

I¡¯m taking back the narrative. As a survivor of murder-suicide, I am more than a murderer¡¯s daughter.

My writing will add to the national conversation on mental health and veteran post-traumatic stress disorder. I hope my story will educate the public and help survivors of this type of tragedy to know they are not alone; the shame is not theirs to carry as they navigate their complex journey.

If you are a survivor of murder-suicide, or know somebody who is looking for support, please consider following my blog here: [www.brittanynoblemccarthy.com](https://www.brittanynoblemccarthy.com). I am connecting with researchers and fellow survivors to reduce the stigma on this awful experience, and help other survivors. I am committed to taking my experience and turning it into a force for good to help others.

ptsd,s_in_progress,2020/2/3,"(Potential trigger warning) My flashbacks are being triggered by public events at my college I was sexually assaulted and nearly killed a little over a year ago- it¡¯s been 389 days, and I¡¯ve survived it, and I am so proud of myself for it. (Was not on campus at the time)

Starting a few days ago, a spotlight was put on my college¡¯s truly terrible handling of sexual assaults on campus, and people are very rightfully upset, because the school seriously and repeatedly fucked up, to the point where they could face legal repercussions. The thing is, the students here are very vocal about and frequently fairly united on their opinions on issues like this. So now I¡¯ve been getting about five emails every day about ¡®addressing campus sexual assault¡¯ or whatever (my tone is dismissive because administration is just trying to minimize the problem without actually trying to solve it) and starting today, there¡¯s a massive sit in in our union building, there are local news crews here to cover it, and there must be thousands of fliers everywhere on campus. It has been months since I was as triggered as I was today. I have had multiple panic attacks, flashbacks, and auditory hallucinations. I feel like I can¡¯t even breathe when I¡¯m not locked away in my room, but even there, I¡¯m starting to feel like a caged animal. I don¡¯t think the organizers of the sit in (the sit in is the reason for all the other things listed) realize how damaging this is to the very population they¡¯re trying to champion, and I don¡¯t know how to fix it enough that I feel okay in my own skin on campus again."

Like I've had C-PTSD and normal PTSD for years but this has broken me in a way that even being raped and homeless didn't manage to. I have constant intrusive thoughts and nightmares. I self harmed for the first time in the psych ward, have been getting suicidal ideation for the first time in four years or so, having meltdowns, can't stand to be around anyone. I have nightmares and flashbacks and have been getting urges to self harm - nearly walked over to the stove, turned on one of the hotplates and pressed my hand against it, but was luckily saved by my hip dislocating and stopping me from being able to walk over to it

just like...have other people experienced PTSD from the psych ward? It's really fucking me up, especially because when I was in there one of the nurses kept on telling me that I would feel grateful one day and like...no I don't I just feel suicidal and traumatised and like they've stolen a huge part of me and broken it and just if I ever get institutionalised again I will kill myself I know it 

one of the nurses also told me that she could understand why my parents abused me based on my personality and that she would have abused me too in that situation. I was also held at a hospital where i had previously let myself be sexually assaulted by a medical professional in order to access treatment which definitely did not help. Especially because the treatment then was a shot to the butt which made the experience of being held down in seclusion and having them pull down my pants to inject me in that exact same spot - absolutely appauling

also they gaslit me over my psychical disability and refused to give me access to my mobility aids and like dislocated my shoulder and my spinal cord and multiple ribs and like if my spine had not been stable when they put me in seclusion I could have been permanently paralysed or dead by the way they handled me"

I still have a ton of anger and resentment from all the bullying and ostracism I went through in school and in the workplace in my 20s. Not just anger towards the bullies, but the peers/coworkers who would observe the bullying, or just laugh at me for being very shy, scared, unhappy, and lonely. I know people will just say ""oh they were just miserable themselves"" or ""they'll end up as failures as adults"". That doesn't explain why they would all smile and be friendly and sociable with each other, but either treat me like I literally didn't exist and purposely ostracize me or just laugh at me like I was subhuman trash. Even in my 20s I had to deal with cruel insults like people laughing at me for never having a girlfriend, laughing and teasing me for being shy, teasing me for not having any friends, etc. Some of these bullies went to prestigious universities (or the same decent-ranked, but not elite one I went to) and had jobs at prestigious companies. It also didn't help that my dad and brother victim-blamed me when I was younger, and my mom didn't seem to think bullying is a serious issue. Even to this day, my brother seems to have no regrets for his bullying, and my mom doesn't hold him accountable at all

I don't have any friends now and I've always struggle to make any. I push myself to attend meetups multiple times per week, and I've only managed to make acquaintances as alot of people are cliquish. If they actually are willing to talk to me, they don't show up to other meetups often, if at all.

I've tried things like meditation, weightlifting and martial arts to improve my confidence and boost my mood, but they haven't helped much.

I've seen therapists in the past and didn't find them very helpful. My last therapist I saw a few months ago was very caring and empathetic, but he didn't really offer any solutions other than saying it wasn't my fault I was bullied and that my family victim-blamed me instead of supporting me. We did some EMDR which helped me erase some trauma that I kept getting flashbacks for, but maybe other than that, I wouldn't say it was worth the $150/hr session

I wouldn't say I'm a total failure due to the bullying I experienced. I do have a 6-figure job and net worth, which is better than alot of men my age who are married with a wife they hate or they've gone through an expensive bitter divorce. Alot of them are also in debt, have to struggle with raising kids or even paying child support, etc. Reading about other people's problems helps a bit with my traumas, but I don't know if they've suffered more than I have

According to my aunts and uncles, though, he was very different in his 20s and 30s.

They say he relaxed some in his 40s out of a sense of guilt and desire to change, but that he was still grim and extremely serious; and that he lightened up tremendously in his early 50s after beginning antidepressants, and that as his 50s went along became outright friendly and jovial.  


I don't know.

ptsd,fuckmoni,2020/2/28,"tw: suicide, abuse. i'm feeling a lot of mixed emotions and i'd just like some support. my mom committed suicide on October 3rd, 2019. for the first few months i was devastated, my life felt so incorrect and i missed her every day. but as time passed and i've had more conversations about her with my dad, my best friend with similar trauma and my psychologist, i've started getting very angry. 

i've realized how much of my childhood and adolescence was broken and fucked up, how much of my life would be different and better if she didn't do the things she did, how much she's subjected me to and never apologized for before she died. 

she spent the entire duration of my life on prescription pills and in bed. she was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and rhumatoid arthritis, but she never at any point pursued physical therapy or exercise, she just slept and watched CNN in bed every day for almost 2 decades, while my dad worked from home and parented me and my older brother. 3 years ago when he got promoted and we had to move 1500 miles away, he had to start working in an office building, leaving my mom in charge of me and my brother. she couldn't handle it. she failed to do the bare minimum of parenting, helping us with homework, taking us to school when we missed the bus, any time we needed help and dad wasn't around she was completely incompetent and ended up verbally abusive. 

i became somewhat of a delinquent, doing a lot of drugs, sneaking out, hooking up, stealing money and cell phones. she was horrible about it, but seemed to take my struggles as an opportunity to pin the family's problems onto me. she never guided me towards a better life because she didn't really want me to do better than her, just like she resented my dad being better than her, verbally abusing him for his accomplishments and calling him a ""narcissist piece of shit"" for being proud of himself. she was glad in some fucked up way that i was doing so poorly, she didn't have to take responsibility for her own problems, because my problems were ""worse"". 

2 days before she died, she took us to a new family psychiatrist, looking to prove what a shitty daughter i am. the psychiatrist analyzed our situation and told her in plain english that she had fucked me up BAD and the problems our family had been going through were absolutely her fault. she was really upset about this, screamed at us all that night about how we don't love or care about her, how she was going to move back up north and never speak to us again, and my poor defeated dad just said ""do it."" she took this as a sign that she wasn't wanted anymore. the next day while i was at school, she had another very similar blowup, took a bunch of pills immediately afterwards, and was asleep and snoring by the time i came home. she never woke up. 

when your abuser is your mom and she committed suicide, how do you handle the endless cycle of anger and guilt when you think about her? i hate how she fucked me up, was aware that she fucked me up, and killed herself to avoid any consequences for her actions. but i also feel so guilty being angry at her, she was so miserable and self loathing already, and i'm such an asshole for hating her. sorry for the rambling, i really hope someone out there understands what this feels like."

ptsd,thirdimpactta,2020/4/12,"Worried i am so sensitive now towards sexual abuse i am seeing abuse in relationships that weren't abusive? (TW: sexual abuse) I had a couple of inappropriate encounters in my youth, some of which involved family members.

my father was never one of these people but suffers heavily from mental illness and didn't know how to handle it so was quite explosive and violent, over the top punishments/fighting etc. we had a pretty rough relationship and i was generally uncomfortable being in his presence.

There were many times that my dad would act slightly inappropriate towards us, grabbing us or smacking our asses, coming into our rooms when he thought we were asleep, and commenting on ourselves and friends but was never actually violent or explicit.

over the last few years my relationship with my dad has gotten a lot better but i still have an awful lot of trouble trying to put boundaries in place, he mostly gets offended and then pretends like i had not said anything.

I have a memory of being a child in my dads shower and he was outside the shower, i don't remember what happened before or after but i remember him being really mad and telling me i had not cleaned myself properly, to which he then quite aggressively clean my vagina.

i have recently started therapy for the other abusive situation which has definitely brought up a lot of feelings and overwhelming emotions but i don't know why this memory has joined with my memories of csa, 

I think not knowing what the intentions of my dad were in that exact moment i could rationalise it and put it away but i cant stop thinking about it and i'm worried its going to very negatively affect our relationship if no bad intentions were there,

i feel like my brain doesn't know who to trust and how to differentiating threatening to not threatening situations and i'm not sure what to do

ptsd,bifemalehan,2020/2/18,"Can a traumatic childhood past lead to issues with intimacy and sexual orientation perception as an adult? Hi! I'm new to this sub but was looking for some insight. 

I (22F) grew up in a household where my sister, mother, and I suffered frequent verbal, emotional, psychological, and physical abuse at the hands of my narcissitic/manipulative father. On top of this, our mother enabled our father's behavior, and when my older sister finally cut ties with them as an adult, they  stalked her and called her crazy for asking them to attend counseling with her for the abuse she had endured. Now that I'm essentially the age she was then, and I have taken the steps to cut ties with my parents, my sister and I are finally able to have a real relationship after years of our abusers keeping us apart and basically divide and conquering us.

So there's my backstory and here's the gist of what I wanted to ask. I pretty much pushed my traumatic past under the rug and didn't validate it for what it was for all of college because I went to college where I grew up and felt it was too hard to realize my past in the same place my parents lived. It wasn't until last fall when my long term boyfriend (23M) and I moved to a city to start our post grad lives. I was finally out of my hometown and away from my parents physically. Then all of a sudden I was hit with immense feelings of isolation, depression, OCD fears, relationship anxieties, and general sadness. It was like all of my childhood trauma resurfaced at once and I was just drowning in it. I had panic attacks after speaking on the phone with my mother, got on SSRI, even took myself to a mental health crisis center at one point. One of my low points to say the least. So I knew I had to go to therapy, and I started therapy for my trauma. I did and it has been somewhat helpful but obviously digging up trauma can mess with your mind a lot. It's very difficult.

My problem now is that since last fall when all this began, I haven't been able to see intimacy the same. Nowadays, I dissociate multiple times a week (something I did on and off growing up), and I feel like I don't know how to be a sexual being anymore. It tears me down because I love my partner a d never had these issues with intimacy with him early on in our relationship,  and now I feel like a stranger in bed. It makes me doubt our connection and whether I am really in love because of that wall that comes up. 

I wondered if anyone knew insights about how childhood trauma affects ones ability to be sexually intimate ( I was not sexually abused as a child, but I was physically). 

I mentioned sexual orientation in the post title because I have identified as bisexual since before entering I to my current relationship. When I wasn't actively dealing with my trauma, I was for all intents and purposes confident about my sexual orientation identity, and I never questioned its validity or whether I really was attracted to my partner. Now, however, I have constant obsessive thoughts that I am not attracted to the opposit sex, and therefore, not really attracted to my partner. These thoughts arise mainly when I'm trying to be intimate and hit that wall of disconnection, but they have also trickled out into everyday thought. So I guess my other question is, does anyone have thoughts as to whether childhood trauma can also affect ones perception of sexual orientation? Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this!

tldr: I was psychologically,  physically, verbally,  emotionally abused growing up. Could this be affecting my ability to be sexually intimate as an adult? Could it be affecting my perception of my sexual orientation?"
ptsd,Anaphora121,2020/4/2,"PTSD hurting my friendship So, some background, I have PTSD due to traumatic experiences involving a childhood best friend and her family. I was diagnosed and started going to therapy about five years ago and after making a ton of progress to the point where I rarely have panic attacks or nightmares anymore, I stopped therapy about a year ago. This was about the point I moved in with my roommate.

My roommate is my best friend; we moved in together because we were close. We usually get along great, but... we just had a really difficult conversation where she told me that my PTSD makes me really hard to be around sometimes. She talked about how she feels that she has to put on her ""emotional kiddie gloves"" around me, because if she raises her voice or expresses anger/criticism, I'll either shut down or panic. She says it's frustrating and makes her feel like a shitty person when she does accidentally upset me.

She's told me things I have to do to be better -- like not taking it personally when she gets angry or actually pushing back when she does something I don't want her to -- and I intend to do them. I just feel so heartbroken because all this time I've been with her, I thought my PTSD was magically cured, but it turns out I only felt better because she was coddling me. It makes me feel like such a defective person.

ptsd,jackgibson12,2020/1/13,"Therapist thinks I have ptsd from childhood trauma, Dr thinks i have panic disorder and depression. Some questions. For the longest time i thought all my problems were from panic disorder, depression, and social anxiety and was optimistic that they could be solved, either through counselling, CBT therapy, or medications. I've tried pretty much all medications out there (benzos, gabapentinoids, antipsychotics, ssris, snris, and stimulants like adderall). the antipsychotics did nothing, ssris and snris did nothing. Benzos helped get through the day but I basically have failed out of school because of them. Adderall helped with focus and social anxiety due to an under active prefrontal cortex causing those, but my doctor wont give stims and benzos at the same time.

My counselor, the person I am most open to, thinks that all of these problems are just symptoms of childhood trauma, dont really want to get into it that much but grew up in a chaotic household and certain important family members and role models were addicted to hard drugs my entire childhood and pretty much everyone in my family has a mental illness.

I don't know what to do. currently having a panic attack so bad i have not left my room all day, skipping lecture and falling even further behind. what medications or other treatments helped you get over this? or is it something i will have to live with and cope with for the rest of my life.."

ptsd,BikeStoleMyThief,2020/2/3,"Remedies for emotional trauma induced fatigue? I'm definitely suffering from emotional trauma, long story short I felt an emotional pain that grew on me to the point where it came so natural to me just to turn off my emotions and although the relief was great. I didn't want to go through life emotionless, not feeling love for anybody or feeling loved, not feeling fear or nervous for anything and missing out on on the experiential part of living life that goes beyond being superficial and surface pretending and wearing a mask was not enjoyable, very exhausting and tiring.

I decided to turn back on my emotions, and to my mistake I did not realize like a kid who shoved all his dirty stuff under the rug to clean his room, so did I on an emotional level so when I turned my emotions off I was subjected to a FULL FORCE of just bad emotions, nightmares, the guilt and the rage was intense, panic attacks ect.. 

Anyways with time, things started to calm down but I'm still stuck with triggers and a bad fatigue that doesn't seem to improve with diet, or training, weight loss or anything on a physical level.

 Things that do help I've noticed is good companionship, but there's a catch, triggers, and my triggers make me want to destroy whoever accidentally or purposely cased the trigger, so that's a no-no for the time being. 

Meditation has had some interesting results but idk what to make off that.

Dry Fasting also has had good results in terms of the mind, it clears up my mind and body and almost like a relief but my mind becomes so squeaky clean, it was so effective it almost brought me to joyful tears but it's only momentary and I haven't tried to do it consistently long term like cycling it and it's super hard there's a lot of preparation that goes into before and after to secure my safety.

&amp;#x200B;

Any other natural suggestions, my last option is going to some medical professional and  getting drugs or just turn off my emotions again if I can do it again that is, I'm not suicidal or anything I will adapt even if it ment ridding myself of experiencing any emotions again even though I hate the cruel unrestricted nature that comes with it and solely live life on a cognitive and intellectual level."

In 2018, I lost my dearly loved aunt of whom I thought of as a second mother totally unexpected to an aneurysm, only a few days later, my grandfather , her father, passed as well. Those events and the aftermath of massive inheritance fights , old family arguments etc lead to our family getting torn apart. The loss , especially my aunt, the fall out of our family, everyone just had gotten back together after years of fights and secrets , seeing my mother cope with the loss of her beloved sister and father and all of this happening in my senior year, I struggled really hard and went to a really bad state of mind.

I finally talked to a doctor about my issues 6 months later , he diagnosed severe depression and said i should see a therapist and after 6 months of being on the waiting list , I finally met her. After sessions over sessions , she diagnosed me with ptsd and told me that she was a big supporter of the EMDR  (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) method , which we tried in a double session. It was an experience out of this world, in the beginning , I struggled so hard so talk about the day my aunt died , couldn¡¯t even say her name without tearing up, and the more I talked and watched her  doing ?the finger stuff¡° it got easier and I was able to express my thoughts and feelings and to find peace with lots of things that happened (letting her go, leaving certain family members behind..). After the session, i felt so incredibly relieved, as if the giant knot that I kept in my throat for nearly 2 years got a lot smaller. I¡¯m now able to talk about her being dead, to be more relaxed around ambulances and hospitals and stuff like that. Of course I¡¯m still in therapy and we are still working on it and my anxiety and self worth issues that I¡¯ve had before this incident and I am so glad that I¡¯m able to do this.
But sometimes , I still fall back and cry on the floor because the scarf I kept from her stopped smelling like her , recently I¡¯ve watched a show about cleaning out the wardrobe of deceased family members and that hit me so hard I cried all night because it brought me back to when we were doing this, but I guess things like this will get less and better to handle over time and while continuing therapy

Gosh, I wrote a ton of stuff , sorry for that but I always think it¡¯s better to explain a few things 

Did any of you have experience with EMDR? Was it such a great Experience for you like it was for me ? How do you feel if you experienced a similar trauma to mine , maybe after a couple years in therapy or so?

ptsd,SadGrlsClubb,2020/1/9,"Just need a place to put this.. I consider myself a well resourced individual in regards to overcoming the traumas I¡¯ve faced throughout my life, and although I¡¯ve continued to push through and tried to find a balance through various medication and talk therapies, I still find navigating the seas of this diagnosis increasingly more difficult. 

We all have our hills to climb, and there¡¯s no one way to do it, but I¡¯m really tired of climbing. My waking hours are often filled with intrusive thoughts, anxiety, and the occasional flashbacks.. but it¡¯s nothing compared to the horrors I face when I close my eyes. 

Nearly every morning I wake in a panic unaware of where I am, feeling just as if I were back in the moment of coherence.. I have overwhelming feelings of shame, loss of self worth, and feel unable to connect with others on more than a superficial layer in person. 

I hide behind my screen and allow others to only receive what I¡¯m willing to give because I¡¯ve had so many before take what wasn¡¯t theirs. 

I¡¯m 29 and can¡¯t imagine a life beyond my reality of the last several years. &amp; while I have made significant improvements, I crave to share my life and love with another but fear I¡¯m too broken to love, as I¡¯ve been told by a previous partner."
ptsd,Memoryknitter,2020/3/23,"As someone with trauma what has been your response to COVID-19? During therapy today , my therapist, told me that all of her clients with trauma have been having very similar responses to the pandemic. Unfortunately, the video cut out and I couldn¡¯t hear what she said the response was from others so I thought I would check in, to ask, and see what the general consensus was.

My response:
I feel an odd sense of calm. I don¡¯t really feel dissociated, but there have been moments when seeing the empty shelves at the store have left me disassociated. In part, I feel at home with the crisis as if it¡¯s something my body and mind know. Yet, there is moments of anxiety where I feel like I¡¯m bracing myself for ¡°just another trauma.¡± I feel like I¡¯ve already been isolated from the world mentally at least so quarantine doesn¡¯t seem to impact me in many ways apart from feeling trapped from the lack of freedom which is probably a trauma related feeling for me. My nightmares are somewhat weirder containing more stress elements, but not much else is very different. 

Some things I have been thinking about with COVID-19 in relation to trauma: When I step outside I think about how it¡¯s not safe and the perceived threat that the whole world is feeling right now seems to represent the perceived threat that those with trauma seem to experience in a regular basis.

And

Lastly, thinking about how scary/sad it would be to get the virus and spread it to others...kind of represents how I sometimes feel contaminated and shameful for my trauma and the way it seems to change my perception of myself and others. 

TL;DR
As a community that already faces the challenge of trauma and PTSD: How are you holding up in the pandemic and how is your trauma/PTSD effecting your response to the COVID-19 pandemic?"
ptsd,fullybased,2020/3/28,"What, exactly, are flashbacks? Hey y'all. I'm pretty new to this diagnosis, though I'm pretty sure I've been dealing with it for several years now. I'm still having a lot of trouble accepting it, and I'm also having trouble understanding a lot of things about it. 

To this end, I'm curious as to what exactly flashbacks really ARE. Like, yeah, I've read the definition, but I'm still lacking a core understanding, I think. I would welcome a variety of opinions on this subject, I think, because it seems that it can manifest pretty differently for different people and I think looking at it from a lot of different angles might help me put the picture together, if that makes sense? 

I'll provide the perspective I'm coming from, for context. 

Flashbacks are portrayed in media as, like, for example, somebody setting off fireworks near a veteran and suddenly they literally think they are back in combat or something, ducking behind rocks and yelling things out to their war buddies that aren't there and stuff. I know media portrayals of mental illness tend to be less that wholly accurate, so feel free to point out what's right and wrong about this example. 

The only other thing I know about flashbacks is that my therapist says I have them. Mine look very different from that, though. I do experience auditory hallucinations, but I can generally figure out pretty quickly that they're not actually there by figuring out the sound I'm hearing doesn't make sense considering my environment, like hearing sirens when I'm driving when there's no ambulance around, or hearing my father's voice calling me from the next room when he's 1000 miles away. 

There's not a lot of triggers that I've yet been able to identify for this other than maybe just some generalized stress. The only other symptom I'm really aware of during this is a little bit of increased anxiety, mostly because I know I'm hallucinating that healthy people shouldn't do that. 

So, if anyone out there is willing to help me gain a better understanding of this, I think that it would be really helpful for me. Thank you so much in advance!!"

San Francisco Research Study

The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of inflammation on emotions and thinking patterns, as well as on the brain. We are looking for participants who would be able to come to the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center for 2 visits.

The first visit to the VA is a screening session, where you would have a blood test, a drug test, medical and psychological interviews, and fill out some questionnaires. This visit would take about 4 hours, and you would be paid $50.

If you are eligible, we will schedule a second study visit. During the second visit you will have a medical interview and blood draw, and you will be given either a typhoid vaccination or an inactive placebo. The typhoid vaccine is approved for adults and children over the age of 2, and is widely administered to people who are leaving the country. You would also get a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scan. You would then complete questionnaires and tasks, and at the end of the visit, you would be asked to give a final blood draw. This visit would take about 8 hours, and you would be paid $165. Participants who take part in the entire study will receive a total of $215.00

ptsd,DifferentNet4,2020/4/8,"PTSD symptoms have evolved from typical flashbacks to preoccupation with the trauma with obsessive thinking. Can anyone relate? TRIGGER WARNING - sexual violence So about 4 years ago, a series of repressed memories from various traumatic events in my childhood surfaced, causing intense flashbacks for about 1-2 years. To give some context, I¡¯ve been raped multiple times, witnessed murder, stabbings, &amp; have had a gun to my head. 

Once I remembered pretty much everything, typical flashbacks and dissociation have become simply anxiety attacks and emotional flashbacks.

ptsd,surprisedmouse,2020/4/1,"Would you consider these to be flashbacks? TW: sexual assault

It's been around 2 years since I was sexually assaulted and I have never remembered the traumatic event itself due to repression. I haven't been officially diagnosed with PTSD but have been given sertraline (zoloft) and beta blockers to handle the symptoms of it.

An issue I have is that several professionals have sounded skeptical when I describe my flashbacks. As I have no memory of the event, what I'd consider to be flashbacks revolve more around events that occurred either side of the rape, such as waking up in an unfamiliar place the next day, interrogation in a police headquarters, invasive medical exams, sometimes simply just an unexplainable surfacing of intense emotions like fear and disgust.

It still feels like I'm really reliving those events but I'm not sure if they count because of the uncertainty doctors and other health professionals have addressed them with when I try to explain them. To me those moments are still traumatic if not actually the event itself.

Are these flashbacks? Or am I just overexaggerating these feelings?

As part of a healing process I though it might help to share this journal entry. I got used to being silenced or threatened not to tell anyone. Therapy has taught me that feeling like you do not have to hide these sorts of things or push them down helps a person process them.

***TRIGGER WARNING FOR CHILD ABUSE***


""I did not go to some offered drop-in counselling today. This was a result of the landlord sending a harassing message that contacted me about matters a clinician covered in a clinical letter. The clinical letter asked them to contact the clinician instead as part of accommodating my tenancy.


I found this to be very isolating and depressing behaviour towards me. I felt as though I was intentionally not being accommodated. It came across as childish- as though a non-consensual and inappropriate relationship was being forced on me instead of the landlord acknowledging violations towards tenants by their intermediary.


It retraumatised me. I have had a freeze response in not wanting to move in order to stop this kind of thing from happening to someone else and having low self worth sometimes.


I had flashbacks today as a result of this mistreatment combined with the abuse I had normalised when I was young.


Today I could smell and feel things that happened when I was younger that caused me to barely eat or not eat anything. I lose my appetite when in this kind of environment and am concerned about my ability to eat properly continuing. This is the first time I have admitted that I may relapse into not eating or barely eating.


When I was in elementary school l started having to miss school to fill the role of a wife to a middle-aged man without my consent. It was to placate his temper and death threats to harm myself or others. He would also molest me but would never call it that. When confronted on it he would make excuses or gaslight me about it. He would also bring me around other middle-aged men, usually on commonly celebrated holidays, and I would have to let them molest me too because I was conditioned to understand that harm would come to myself or others if I did not let this happen.


The landlord's behaviour and enabling of the superintendent while contacting me on matters that a clinician has already provided clinical input on (and asked for her to be contacted instead) has been triggering for me.


The middle-aged man would force me to take gifts and hush money or beg him for economic support. He started doing this to me as a child on what he told me was advice from a doctor so I would feel like I could not tell anyone the true depth of the abuse and manipulation. It also prevented me from ever looking for support outside of his control or manipulation.


I was being intimidated into thinking a doctor was not only protecting his molestation and abuse of me but actively advising him to make me take hush money to hide and perpetuate it. This prevented me from connecting to social services, abuse intervention or clinical services that would remove his access to me and not keep this hidden. He brainwashed me into learned helplessness so I could not survive without allowing for a lack of boundaries to be taken against my body and person for the benefit of another without my consent.?


I feel like I have been a prisoner of war my whole life to feed the sick wants of corrupt men and their enablers. This comes from trauma bonding and behaviours associated with Stockholm syndrome.


I have never been able to work through this before because doing so would interfere with keeping me silenced. I have never been allowed to work through this before because keeping the people who did this to me safe and those who enabled them safe was more important than my personhood and well-being. If I was considered a person this would not have happened to me.


I was failed by people I should have been able to trust and it was never my fault."""

ptsd,throwaway2463289,2020/3/31,"Potential C-PTSD, advice appreciated (TW: sexual abuse, self harm, suicidal thoughts) This is my first post on here and it's a bit nerve wrecking but here goes.

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of context:

I've known that I have PTSD for about a year now. I realised at the end of a therapy course I was having at the time for different issues, and haven't had therapy dedicated to PTSD in the time since. I honestly thought I was getting better and that the flashbacks were getting less severe and less frequent, but my partner helped me realise that I had been repeatedly manipulated for sex by a previous partner, separate to the original trauma. Realising that you have been repeatedly raped at a time when you were trying to recover from your first rape isn't the nicest if I'm honest. I have also suffered from narcissistic abuse from my mother throughout my childhood, and which is still ongoing. I also still see my ex-partner who manipulated me into sex around uni.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm wondering if i have C-PTSD, as I can relate to a lot of the symptoms listed online. I feel scared, *all the time*. Not even of anything specific, just a deep sense of unease and fear of everything. I'm terrified I will be raped again, I'm terrified I won't get better, I'm terrified that I'm making it all up and that I should just 'get over it'.  I can't sleep at night because my mind gets stuck in a loop of reliving what happened and thinking about it. Sometimes I wake up to what I call a 'PTSD day', where I'm effectively useless all day because I can't stop the horrible feelings and thoughts that stem from the trauma. Being around my partner helps a lot on these days, but there is no way I can engage in sex (although I have once done that and immediately felt awful afterwards, but I don't deny consenting to it all). Being in quarantine and separated from my partner (who I usually live with at uni), and also being exposed again to narcissistic abuse from my mother, has led to a rather difficult time recently. I constantly feel hopeless and empty, I constantly feel like I'm worthless and I deserve what happened to me, and I have been experiencing depersonalisation and suicidal thoughts for several years now. I also used to regularly engage in self harm, and this has returned a little since being at home. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that reddit isn't the best place to get a diagnosis, and I fully intend to go back to therapy once quarantine is over, but I'm struggling with how to cope for now. I get flashbacks every night as I try to sleep, resulting in insomnia and tiredness throughout the day. I'm worried that I'm a burden on my partner, who has been amazing and so helpful to me with my mental health.

She's been attending therapy and is currently transitioning to new meds, but has been suffering mood swings and anxiety and panic attacks that often break down into attempts at self harm and suicidal thoughts. I have to physically hold her back from grabbing a knife and hurting herself or trying to OD on meds, which scares the shit out of me for more than one reason. 

She's a very private person who's had her support structure (other than me) fall out from under her. Neither her or I've ever dealt with anything like this before. I'm not sure if I can afford my own therapist, but dealing with all of this has been really, really hard and I feel like I have no one to talk to.

April 1st is the anniversary of my trauma and today was the 5-year mark. Every year I dread all of the April Fool's jokes because it always reminds me of the worst experience of my life, and it usually puts me in such a bad episode that I spend a few days on the verge of tears and panic attacks. Next week will also be 1 year since a person I loved died, so overall the first week of April is just a really shitty time in my life. On top of the quarantine, I'm alone in a relatively new city and have absolutely none of my usual support network in place. Last night I felt so alone and stressed because I was worried about how my PTSD would ruin my week.

Even with all of that, I made it through today without a single tear. No panic attacks, no flashbacks, no disassociation. I went for an early morning walk, crossed some major things off my to-do list, and had a video call with a good friend. I know I'm not cured and that every day is different, but today feels like it was a monumental victory. I hope you can all find some little victories and moments of freedom, too!"
ptsd,Unusual_Table,2020/3/10,"Requesting advice for anxiety around men... Hello humans, 

Below is a non-graphic summary of my current predicament and I was hoping to gain some advice!

I work in the live production world in general - concert/theatrical touring shows specifically - and I am 26 years old. This interest of mine began in high school when I had the opportunity to participate in our school's theater program for which I built sets, hung lights, and operated audio. This was also my first co-ed experience as from age 4 to 18 I went to an all girls school. To put on theater productions, however, we would work with the all boys school across the street. While I did well in theater back then, I was often ignored by the other students and teachers as they all came from the boys school and weren't sure how to interact with me... I think. Even when I became a vital participant in making productions happen, I kept to myself because I was also put off by the social dynamic of the boys.

I pursued this in New York City where I went to college during which time being the only woman on a production crew was also the norm. In 2013 and 2015 respectively I had a violent experience as it pertained to men wanting access to my body. The earlier was while working at a music festival, the later was during an off campus Black Student Union event. At those times I was eager to put those experiences behind me and forget about it however still fell into a sort of social anxiety/paranoia from 2015-2017 at which point I left New York City taking the freelancing rhythm of my life on the road. I was based out of Maryland that summer yet traveled to festivals all over the country for the job I had. Then I spent the next several months out in Virginia where I attended a great church with a female pastor and a congregation that consisted of about twenty women and two men. The community there was a big catalyst for me pulling myself back together.

After that I applied for and accepted my first permanent job in a management position at a concert venue in Washington DC but in the eight months I was there received progressively unnerving approaches from one of the male staff members. That compounded with my desire to get back on the road touring prompted me to quit. On top of all that, working with the same large group of men day to day made me more paranoid than working with men in passing on my typical 1-3 month gigs. However I assumed that it might've just been a symptom of the overall environment of that workplace.

Currently I am on my longest tour yet: an 11 month contract that began in July 2019. By this point I noticed the overwhelming pattern that I am only able to feel relaxed around women. I'm responsible for all the logistics of the tour unit. I'm the one who dictates who rides in each car and who is where on each bus. For all of these I've made it so I'm only with women whether that be in a car or in a certain area of the bus. However my fellow managers are men and recently I was forced to change the car assignments due to a change in our overall production schedule. Because of this I share an office with them in each arena or theater we go to. The crew, as per usual, is also mostly men. While things were mostly fine from July-November, since December I've been developing a growing sense of anxiety around my coworkers for seemingly no good reason. This culminated two weeks ago with me having a panic attack from sitting between two of them on a four hour plane ride during which they were asleep most of the time which resulted in lots of accidental physical contact and being breathed on.

I've been averse to physical contact my whole life but since college it evolved into more of an acute fear. Because of this I modified my wardrobe so that everything but my face and hands was covered at all times creating a bit of a buffer or even a deterrent.

My main frustration now is that these men are not doing anything. They are of no threat to me. Yet my body is reacting as if they were constantly. Due to the nature of my job I'm practically living with these people. Because of all this I'm searching for methods or strategies to make these feelings stop.

Any advice would be appreciated!"
ptsd,JustSomeRandomMan3,2020/1/13,"Today I saw two people fall off a mountain and die Hello.
Today my girlfriend and I (and two other friends) were hiking a mountain in Italy, in the Apuane Alps. We were about to have lunch at a ""rifugio"" when we heard two people screaming from a nearby mountain. We thought at first that it was just some people being silly and screaming because they had climbed all the way up, but then we spotted two figures, around 300 meters away, plummeting down a very steep rocky side of Mount Sella. They were screaming while falling, then stopped vocalizing half way (probably they fainted or died), then crashed into a rock, making a thud so loud that it sounded like a demolition ball. We were like 99% sure they were dead. A few other hikers were there and saw the scene, and also more people came by, and we called the hospital helicopter. They came in like 20 mins and managed to retrieve the corpses a few hours later (because of the very remote location). It was a married couple, we later found out, 52 and 47 years old.
My girlfriend and I are a little shocked, cause of course it's not nice to see something like this happening...

 I can barely remember anything from my childhood, and when I do remember and talk to my parents about it, they say it never happened.

 I don't recall anything bad happening, but I had depression ever since I was little. (I also have many disorders and conditions, though I don't think they're that relevant)

 My parents divorced when I was 7, but they were always good friends, I remember my mom hitting me (but she insists she never did that), my mom was in a different country most of the time to get citizenship and my dad was always working, so I was usually home alone. I had an imaginary friend named hugo who was the embodiment of my intrusive thoughts, he told me to harm myself.
I never had real friends until I was 13, the ones before were just using me for bullying, but I was just as annoying as them, I deserved that.

I have many disorders and conditions that have trauma as one of the root causes (anxiety, dissociation, aphantasia, etc.) But I don't really know if I suffer from PTSD, my childhood seems pretty normal but thinking your childhood is normal is also a symptom of PTSD."

ptsd,tinfoil--hat,2020/4/10,"repressed memories surfacing or false memories being created? tw: ptsd, sexual assault, attempted murder, mentions of r*pe
my therapist told me i have ptsd last year with severe dissociation. but, she¡¯s not a trauma specialist. i took several screenings and tests that confirmed this, and i have every symptom, but i keep telling myself im faking everything. there are several traumatic events from my past that i remember¡ª the earliest being from when i was in third grade. i really don¡¯t remember the majority of my childhood though, everything is cloudy. (now to the point of this post) i¡¯ve always had an abnormal relationship with sex, ever since i was very young. i always felt like something was off, and i was /extremely/ uncomfortable around men older than me. i thought this was normal for little girls. semi-recently i found out something had happened with my uncle. he¡¯s an alcoholic, and one day he tried to strangle his wife. their son had to break down the door and hold him down while my younger cousin called the police. i didn¡¯t hear much about the specifics of the case, but i also think he tried to r*pe her, since he was screaming about how he¡¯s been ¡°fvcking prostitutes anyways.¡± anyways, after hearing this, i had a panic attack and i felt like things started making sense. out of nowhere, repressed/fake memories appeared from when i was much younger (elementary school?), and i immediately assumed i was making things up since i also have ocd, and sexual trauma from my later years (mostly in 8th grade). but, it also felt so real, and it would explain a lot of things about why i react to certain things in a different way than everyone else, and how much i knew about sex from an extremely young age without doing any research on what it actually was. i have no idea if learning about the events with my uncle triggered repressed memories, especially since i¡¯ve been working on other trauma work with my therapist, or if learning about this story made me create a whole scenario in my head to explain why my views on sex have always been so drastically different than my peers. i feel awful and disgusting. deep down i think it happened, but my ocd and ptsd make me doubt everything. i¡¯ve had other repressed memories surface while working with my therapist that i know are true, so i know my brain is capable of repressing memories. but, if i did subconsciously create this whole thing, i feel so awful towards actual CSA survivors, like i¡¯m invalidating their experiences by breathing. im crying thinking about it now. i¡¯ve NEVER told anyone about this, or even wrote about it before now, and i dont think i¡¯ll ever tell anyone about these thoughts. i just want to know if they actually occurred or if im just a sick twisted person that thinks these awful things happened to me as a young child when they actually didnt."
ptsd,soggy-lumps,2020/1/24,"Is it possible to have very minor ptsd as a result of situations caused by social anxiety? First things first, I in no way intend to be disrespectful, or undermine the experiences of anyone with this post. I am really scared to post this because I¡¯m preempting negative or hostile responses regardless of how supportive and nice this community seems, so please be considerate if you intend to comment. Also, I probably won¡¯t look at the comments for a long time as a way to reduce the fear I¡¯ll feel when reading them. So keep that in mind if you¡¯re expecting a reply from me. 

I experience social anxiety a lot. And quite severely too. Even with medication and regular therapy it still affects my daily life to a great extent. 

For those of you not familiar, social anxiety disorder could be summarised as an intense, usually irrational fear of being judged by others. Yes, of course it makes oral presentations a NIGHTMARE, but it also affects how loud I play music when home alone, in the fear that neighbours will judge my (un-noteworthy) music taste. Or what brands I buy, in fear of the cashier judging me. Or what pictures I set as my lock screen in case someone else sees it. Basically, it¡¯s a very irrational fear that I¡¯m very aware of. Regardless, I have little control over it as it is essentially instinctual, as y¡¯all probably understand. 

Every now and then something will happen in my life that causes me great stress. A mundane event that becomes worse when combined with my SAD. Usually this is some form of criticism. The symptoms I¡¯ve found most prominent are the main symptoms of PTSD; increased anxiety/aggression, reliving the event when triggered, avoidance of things I once enjoyed because of the event, things somewhat related to the event triggering anxiety and stress, dreams and nightmares surrounding the event etc. I¡¯ll provide a few examples of these affecting me below. Not all of my symptoms, because I¡¯m writing on mobile and some of them are self explanatory. 

For example, I used to do low level volleyball. The training sessions were really difficult for me as, being a beginner, I feared how my team perceived my ability. It continued like this, and was particularly bad during one session. I can¡¯t remember what happened, which is pretty standard for my stressful memories, but I know it didn¡¯t appear severe otherwise others on my team would also remember. For weeks after, the topic of volleyball caused great stress to me. 

The thought of practicing or going to games caused panic attacks. When I thought of the event my core would seize up, heart rate would increase, limbs would start trembling, and sometimes my breathing would speed up or become sporadic. A bit like a mini panic attack, without all the symptoms or duration (these episodes lasted a few seconds, 10 at the most).  

I would avoid the topic of volleyball for weeks after, even stopping reading a book series that mentioned volleyball because it reminded me too much of the event. I would lose interest in volleyball, despite me actually really enjoying it. 

It¡¯s been a few years, but thinking of this instance still causes some of these symptoms, to a lesser degree. I don¡¯t think I¡¯ve ever had nightmares about this specific situation, but similar events have had negative influences on my dreams in the past. 

I¡¯ve provided examples of these symptoms in relation to /just one/ event, but keep in mind this still occurs for all of my most stressful experiences which are numerous. 

Idk. I just feel kinda bad posting this here, because there are people with legitimately debilitating symptoms from horrible experiences and I¡¯m curious about my problems, which are comparably laughable. And I¡¯m worried I¡¯m doing this ¡®for attention¡¯ or to be ¡®special¡¯, which I¡¯m not. I just can¡¯t help worrying about how others will see this post, and whether I can even trust my own motives. Anyway, thanks for your time. I don¡¯t have anyone else I can talk to, so this is helpful."

ptsd,dawnelenor,2020/4/18,"Can PTSD lead to psychosis? Here I am again. I've been posting on reddit before about my severe anxiety and fear of psychosis.

But still, as a background note:
I am a 23 year old woman, currently unemployed, with no history of psychosis/schizophrenia in my family, but with history of trauma (bullying, abusive father, parental divorce, neurological illness of my twin brother). I'm currently living with my mother and twin brother.

So, because of the whole covid quarantine, I engaged in online therapy. I contacted a clinician psychologist  via a mental health website following a video evaluation and a series of tests for diagnosis. 
After all of them, I scored very high in most anxiety disorders which are: PTSD (highest), health anxiety, generalized anxiety, panic disorder and OCD.
I also did a psychosis test which came out with 0 points result, meaning that I have no hallucination or delusion.
She adviced me to continue talk therapy and (optional) medication but accentuated the talk therapy. 
 I'm currently still trying to save some money for the upcoming sessions so right now I can't attend them.

The thing is this: for the past month I've been dealing with derealization and been stuck inside my head all day.
I have a huge fear of developing psychosis or schizophrenia after accidentally coming across on google while searching for symptoms of dissociation.

As mentioned, I don't have hallucinations or delusions, but I experience some things maybe related to my PTSD. For example:
- when my brother doesn't answer my phonecalls I get a panic attack and racing thoughts about something terribly happening to him (he is diagnosed with epilepsy).
- I tend to avoid songs, places, movies, topics that remind myself of my trauma experiences, otherwise I think they might reoccur.
- I have a tic that's lip picking, when i'm stressed or bored.
- I have agoraphobia due to a traumatic event when I passed out 5 years ago (due to hypoglycemia) and always go out feeling tense and stuck in my head.
- when I get derealization, I struggle to focus on my surroundings and my speech.
- when I send a text to a friend or say something that might upset them, I think about that a lot of get scared of them wanting to distance from me (it happens only ocasionally, but it's still concerning me).
- being stuck in my head, I became a bit less responsive to conversations with my family.

My traumas were triggered when I was 9,13,14 and 18.
Ever since the evaluation, I began to think a little more clear about my mental state but I still have the psychosis themed fear and the idea of losing my mind or losing control of myself terrifies me.
In the past year my self esteem has been very affected, I don't feel in control of myself and feel like I lost my independent life; I feel the need to rely on my mother and brother. Before that, I used to trust myself and my mother and brother relied on me too. They still do, but I feel like I'm the one who can't rely on myself.
All of this happened after getting the psychosis fear.

I read somewhere that PTSD can come with secondary psychosis in a much higher rate than in general population and it scared me badly considering my phobia.
I feel like I need more information on this, as my fear convinces me that because I have PTSD, I might get psychosis too.
Are there any important details about this? Does psychosis in PTSD manifest the same way as in regular psychosis? Why do some PTSD sufferers develop it and other PTSD sufferers don't?
Does my personal case suggest I might develop psychosis?"

In the following days my partner became more and more agitated and anxious. We looked it up online and found an article describing ¡®post engagement anxiety¡¯, which apparently can effect up to 75% of people who are proposed too. 

We hoped following this that the effects would calm down eventually, however yesterday my partner was struggling to eat or drink, very upset, and confessed they were having suicidal impulses. At times they were so scared they could barely speak. I called a helpline who recommend we go to hospital. After a long wait my partner was given some diazepam to help calm their nerves. We were then told that there was no such thing as post-engagement anxiety, and that we shouldn¡¯t believe everything we read on the internet, and that my partner always had a choice about if they wanted to get married. They also recommended we try beta blockers to try and manage the anxiety, which we have a proscription for.

He has COPD, so if he contracts the virus his chances of survival are pretty thin. She told me I should call him in case he deteriorated quickly. When I called him to check in, he couldn¡¯t stop telling me how he couldn¡¯t get enough air... how he felt like he was drowning. It felt like the man who I consider to be my father was dying... and he was in pain... and he wasn¡¯t in peace... and he was alone.  I was on the phone completely unable to be with him or advocate for him, and eventually he had to hang up because talking took too much of the air that he was already struggling to get. 

I knew I was traumatized from how my body felt, but then I recognized something that was going on that I hadn¡¯t paid attention to before. I was trying to tell my husband what supplement I needed to help with the kidney infection I had. All I had to say was ¡°cranberry pills¡±, and I couldn¡¯t. I couldn¡¯t find those words. I could visualize it and knew what it looked like and what it was I wanted, but there were no words able to come out of my mouth. 

And then I remembered reading that when they ¡°retraumatized¡± willing ptsd sufferers during an MRI, the Broca¡¯s area, the part of the brain responsible for speech production, went dark. Knowing this helped me understand myself and give myself grace for not being able to say, ¡°cranberry pills¡±. It was oddly empowering to be smart or knowledgeable enough to be able to recognize the physical response I was having. 

So it felt like going into a video game boss fight already knowing how it¡¯s going to attack instead of just going into it blind."
ptsd,[deleted],2020/4/13,"Quite a Ride My therapist praised me for practicing activities that were considered ""good processing"" one week and then the next week told me that those same practices should be dismissed through ""mental blocking"" and that I was poising myself to be a danger to others.

I've got a video conference call with a therapist I used to meet with on Wednesday.

I'm a two-time combat vet, I served in Iraq (Al-Anbar) for a year in 06-07, and Afghanistan 09-10 as infantry in the Marine Corps. Since I got out of the military in 2010 I have always been good because of my insane drive to do things ""right"" or OCD as the Dr puts it. But I just can't find any consistency and it makes suicide seem like a viable and practical option at this point. I genuinely don't know how to be a normal person anymore, I've had good ""starter jobs"" where I destroy myself working my fingers to the bone and everyone around me says they want to promote me. It always comes crashing down with extreme anxiety I hide from other people, 2019 was the worst year of my life and I'm sitting here on new years eve thinking, ""do I really want another year?"". In 2019, I got divorced by a wife who cheated and then got an abortion without telling me, had to quit my job because she wanted to live in a place we could only afford on two incomes, and paid off the rest of the 6 months remaining on the lease by eating nothing but tortilla's and peanut butter while working at McDonald's and living on the floor of my old friends house. I used to have such energy to start over and get motivated about the next big thing. While I was working at MCD I got promoted to shift manager and my strange and bad communicating boss(genuinely I think her anxiety kept her from being capable of reassurance or straight forward communication). She always said nice things and told me what a good job I was doing but, the more I worked the more it became me picking up just a little bit more of everyone else's job until I was working to the point of being drenched in sweat every single night ( I managed the overnight). I did such a good job in fact, that when an employee called out or the shift before me left a huge mess it started to give me panic attacks because I was 100% positive I wouldn't be able to deliver the results I was normally capable of. During this process I found out I was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. It wasn't the kind of thing where the doctor said ""you arent going to make it"" but hearing the big ""C"" word when you already have diagnosed PTSD/Acute anxiety disorder, and are stressed beyond belief in this kind of job while sleeping on the floor because you are still paying off debt from a divorce you didn't want was ""it"". I just couldn't take it anymore, so I quit and came home to my parents farm while I got treatment, I am cancer free now post surgery by 7 days and I genuinely can't find it in myself to start over again. I just want to give up on life because it feels like a cycle of try hard and do the right things and wait for some non-existent god to answer prayers for stability, I look around and realize I genuinely am a good person who wants the absolute best for people around me. Then I struggle to ever find anything that takes the edge off so that I can not be freaking out as the pressure builds and gives me chest pains. What is life and why do I have to keep doing it?"

ptsd,brynhildan,2020/4/17,"I'm reliving my past traumas again in real life, what do I do? I used to work in an environment where people were a lot more senior, therefore, a lot more mature in their wisdom and tact. I was very used to this environment and I thrived and I was very happy, it fitted well with my own personality. It was a very decent, civilised work environment, everyone knew their part they need to play, we supported each other, provided constructive criticism when needed. As long as you did your work right, didn't slack off and you got along with everybody, it was all fine. There was a real accountability when someone at work wasn't pulling their weight. But of course you cannot choose who you work with. In my current situation, I can see people who has had experience in a professional work environment were much more understanding and mature. However, the people who did not have any background in a professional work environment, has a tendency to  intimidate, gossip, competitive in a way that puts others down and also have a poor work ethic. It is definitely a very high school-esque kind of dynamic in this work place. This strongly reminds me of my traumatic experiences I had in high school which consisted of these kinds of people. I just don't understand how some people never moved on from their high school lives and still acts in that sort of way. The cumulative experiences I had in high school ultimately led me to witness a suicide of a friend and me having to deal with life long PTSD.

I really enjoyed the class despite the hard work and the time crunch (it was an intersession class, so the whole 15 week course was condensed into 3 weeks).

However, the other day I was doing a homework assignment that asked us to decide if the given scenarios were rape. I was immediately uncomfortable and when I got to the 4th scenario, I had to take a break and calm down because it was nearly the same situation in which I was assaulted 

Today, I took my final exam, and because it wasn't comprehensive, a lot of the questions were about sexual assault. Some described situations, but others just talked about the reactions that people have after experiencing sexual trauma.

It really triggered me. Having to identify the different stages of reactions post-rape made me think of my own assault and it was just too much. I did manage to pull myself together, and I still got an A on the exam, but I feel so emotionally exhausted and just plain upset.

I'm frustrated because it's been a while since I've been triggered like this, and I know I've been making progress, but I'm sad I'm in this place again, especially since I know to expect that I won't really be feeling myself the next couple days.

Hey guys, first-time poster on this group. I was diagnosed with PTSD last summer and have been struggling since with communication between loved ones. I¡¯ve found it hard to seek help and the few times that I do express my feelings, I¡¯ve found it especially hard to properly communicate. Often what I find is I¡¯ll get told: ¡°you¡¯re not the only one who has been through this¡± and to ¡°calm down¡± if I get panic episodes from people close to me. It feels like they¡¯re minimizing my issues yet get upset if I don¡¯t reach out for help. 

Alternatively, if I reach out to my partner or certain people who also share PTSD or similar trauma, in this case r*pe, I¡¯ll accidentally trigger the other by only speaking from my experience; I do this because I don¡¯t want to speak for other people. They too then feel I¡¯m acting as if I¡¯m the only one who has gone through this. It isn¡¯t my intention at all to isolate other people. If I do accidentally trigger the other person when addressing something related to my trauma, for example the other individual triggering me, I find myself spending the whole time apologizing to the point where it¡¯s forgotten how it started. The focus will only be that I triggered them and have to apologize even if it started by them triggering me and me attempting to communicate that.

Does anyone else run into this issue or have any advice on how to avoid these situations? I hate accidentally upsetting other people while confiding in them. I try extremely hard to avoid situations by choosing my words as carefully as I can but it feels as if I¡¯m always doing something wrong. At times it makes me resent myself too for having PTSD because I feel it puts up barriers between myself and others."

ptsd,ignoring_you,2020/1/2,"Possible trigger: is this a case of sexual abuse? Just have a quick question. Wasn't sure which subreddit to post this, so I just went with this since my friend is claiming complex PTSD. 

Anyway, my friend recently told me that her grandmother used to molest her when she was very young. When I dug a bit deeper, she said something about her grandmother repeatedly treating her for possible UTI's after she'd go swimming. She mentioned other behaviors her grandmother would do to her (that were admittedly creepy), *however,* I'm not entirely sure if she was really abused or not.

It seems that her grandmother was medically treating her, but she claims that the grandmother would penetrate her when applying medication.  She claims that she would scream and cry and beg her not to do it. She also mentioned that the grandmother asked her to not tell her parents, which, yes, seems like an obvious tip off, but I could see why she may not want her parents to know, because it might make it appear just as the situation sounds.  Although... wouldn't the parents be responsible for treating her UTI's first?  I asked her if possibly her parents were aware (to feel her out to see if they gave the grandmother an OK to treat her UTI's), but she said her mother flipped out one day when she asked why her mother didn't put medicine on her like her grandmother did. It appears the mother didn't know and was quite angry, but she didn't say what the father's reaction was (it was his mom, so maybe he did give the OK and just kept the mother in the dark?). 

So I suppose that's my question: am I being a shitty friend for not believing that what she went through was sexual abuse? It seemed medicinal to me, but I dare not challenge her on it, for obvious reasons. I just wanted to run it by everyone here. Therefore, what constitutes sexual abuse towards a young child? I mean, if your kid needed an enema, would that be considered abuse? No, right? So would a grandmother putting medicine on a girl's genitals for repeated UTI's be considered abuse?  She said her earliest memories of this happening was around when she was 4, so maybe her memories aren't that accurate as well?"
ptsd,jodieraven,2020/4/10,"Abuse victims with PTSD, have you guys also noticed how abuse is used for comedy in media? It's kinda painful to see what causes me so much heartache used in comic relief. I've mostly seen this with emotional and physical abuse. For example, i remember seeing good luck Charlie as a kid and seeing how neglected Gabe was. He was the 3rd out of 5 siblings, but the parents treat the other 4 kids with more love and attention than him. Causing him to act out and be a delinquent. (And Disney loves to copy this dynamic into other shows)
A more recent example I've seen is in my favorite game Persona 5 the Royal, the character Ryuji had already been physically abused by his dad and coach, then his friends casually called him ""stupid"" and beat up on him. There's even a controversial scene in the original Persona 5 where Ryuji is implied to get assaulted by two stereotypical gay men. And this isn't the first example of a character abused for comedy in the history of Atlus games.
As a domestic violence victim who's abuse was treated as comedy or punishment in real life, it brings me back to a time where my pain was used as a punchline. My abuser and his friend thought it was funny when I got upset in response to abuse. Im not trying to be some tumblrina complaining, im trying to explain that abuse isnt funny and shouldn't be treated as such."

But when I was 13 things took a turn for the worst; I was raped by my neighbor on the steps to my brothers bedroom in my attic. That started my downhill spiral. 

I have been diagnosised with PTSD from the rape and the cancer, depression, anxiety, PPD, etc. 

I started DBT a few weeks ago; my therapist told me she wasn't comfortable with putting me with the woman she was training; which the way I took it was I was pretty much too fucked up in the head for a newer therapist to take my case. 

I was dating a guy for six weeks; he found out that I still love my ex I will call him B just for the sake of this (not the father to my children), I'm not sure why I love this man; he is addict, and alcoholic, so I am not sure why I love him; besides the fact of I thought that I could be a save a ho and get him clean and sober. He told me for a year and a half that he didn't believe in marriage; it was just a piece of paper and he was never going to propose to me or get married to me. Well on Monday evening is when I found out my ex was engaged to this girl he has been seeing for the last year; which by the way I was still seeing my ex. 

Well the new guy which I'll call J, found out on Tuesday evening while he was at my house how I felt about B; I wasn't going to lie to J about B. As I don't want to be with B, yes I love him; but I don't want to be with him; why would I want to be with someone who can't keep his shit together! Well long story short J blew up on me all day yesterday; and told me that I was so unfixable, he also threw in my face about my parenting and that I suck as a parent due to an indicent that occured a year ago.

My mother recently decided to steal my dog and continuously talks about me and my personal mental illness struggles(suicidal ideation,etc) to my siblings and dad to the point where no one in my family wants to talk to me anymore. She is like the queen bee that always has to have her way. 

My parents are divorced by the way yet she still has a hold over my dad because he is still in love with her even though he couldn¡¯t quit drinking or gambling or smoking or any of his issues for our family.

Most recently, my mom decided to steal my dog from me after having her babysit him for a week and told me not to come to her house anymore because I¡¯d be trespassing so I can¡¯t even see my dog. Told me if I want him back I¡¯d need to take her to court (so in the process of this now- really didn¡¯t want to do it but had no other choice). I adopted him and have all the paperwork and the cops in the area won¡¯t help me get him back because she¡¯s also a cop even though she¡¯s not allowed to work anymore until Cleared by a psychologist which I think is unlikely to happen.

She consistently blames all dysfunction in the family on my BPD which was likely caused by family issues so it just seems like a never ending blame game in my family.

Is there any hope for this situation? I recently saw some texts pop up on my dads phone and it was unlocked so I honestly invaded privacy to see what was going on behind my back and the things my mom was saying about me were devastating. Accusing me of not being able to foster healthy relationships, etc, basically anything you¡¯ll google on BPD that¡¯s negative she¡¯ll throw at other people and me to hurt me somehow.

I really don¡¯t know what to do anymore, seems like a lost cause.

Is this normal behaviour for parents to bash their kids to their kids faces and to each other and get siblings in on anything.

Right now my mom has convinced everyone in the family that the dog is better off with her and I¡¯m once again the bad guy because I¡¯m suing her for the dog back."
ptsd,tokenqueerpeer,2020/1/15,"What¡¯s the difference between obsessively re-running a memory and having a flashback? Today I was talking with my therapist about what I thought had been a really intense panic attack where I was fixated on remembering seeing my friend dead in the hospital and he explained that it may have been a flashback. I always thought flashbacks had to involve complete loss of awareness of what was going on around me or something like that?
I have also had ¡°clips¡± of memories from a separate experience pop into my head and replay over and over at random times which can be upsetting but aren¡¯t always. Are those also flashbacks? 

I¡¯m so confused and I know this is better sent to my therapist, I¡¯m just trying to get more info from people who have experienced flashbacks"
ptsd,SeaSideGuide,2020/2/21,"Unsure of what my status is? For the longest time I heard from my therapist about the healing process, so eventually when I stopped seeing a therapist I came to the conclusion that I was healed. Personally I believe it¡¯s impossible to be healed or fully recovered with PTSD, its more of you come to terms with your trauma and while it doesn¡¯t fully damage how you continue to live your live it certainly keeps some remnant components in. IE: you have some triggers and they might make you feel a certain way but they don¡¯t immediately send you into a panic attack or stop you from finishing your day. Anyway until this week I was sure I had come to terms with it. From around the age of 2 til I was 10, I was physically abused and neglected. When I was turning 10 I ran away and my neighbours had called the cops, found my mother intoxicated and drugged out. Due to Costa Rica being a mainly matriarchal society, my foreign father didnt get immediate custody and I was sent to a children¡¯s shelter for 3-4 months (got poisoned during my time there, 0/10 would not recommend) father won the legal case and I hopped on the next plane to the States to meet my father. I am  now 17 and well I receive occasional text from my mother to which I send semi-update pictures of myself but otherwise do not respond. For the last 1-2 years I realized I became a lot less paranoid about my back facing windows or doors, until last week. My English Prof.¡¯s room has spinning, rolling desk which can be moved around the classroom. Recently this week he decided to assign people to desk and form the desk in a circle against the walls of the room forming a nearly closed U for him to give his lectures, unfortunately I received desk number 27 which is on the Windowed wall which is nearly 80 window. I went ahead and took my seat and wrote my name on the card attached to it and decided to not make a deal of it because obviously everyone would have to rewrite their names on new cards and switch the order which truthfully sounded like a hassle also I didnt want to create a scene where ¡°oh fuck we have to redo everything cuz this mofo has PTSD¡± so throughout the whole class I have this weird sensation at the end of my spine/ base of my neck. As of the past month my nightmares have increased to a semi-daily schedule which has been utterly delightful.  BTW- previous history with nightmare&amp;PTSD aiding meds, been off of them for 2 years. 

TLDR: Semi-daily nightmares of waking up nearly every hour to every 2 hours. Paranoia/discomfort when back faces windows or doorways. After having nearly 2 years of minimal/no paranoia and only 1-2 nightmares per might. Unsure if my ¡°recovery¡± started to unwind."
ptsd,_toborobot_,2020/4/17,"Ptsd flashbacks and intrusive thoughts are intense today I am having a hard time with not feeling drowned by all the mental images and frustration and memories from my childhood. I can¡¯t stop crying in my bed. I keep thinking and realizing weird messed up things as I was growing up and it makes me in so much pain. I have obsessive intrusive thoughts trying to control whether or not I should grab certain objects, such as spoons, look at the window over and over again to avoid something bad happening. I did dishes, cooked, read workbooks, took 3 baths and I still feel unreal...or too real. I go into my meditation safe place and I just imagine me crying, screaming for these thoughts to leave me alone. Even typing this, choosing the right words, trying to control not choosing words that might make my intrusive thoughts stay. I have biweekly therapy sessions and on Monday I have one, i thought of writing here to see if would be able to relate to anyone and know I¡¯m not alone."
ptsd,Purdy-girl-666,2020/2/7,"Something that grinds my gears a bit.... First of all, I don't mean to offend anyone, especially veterans/people who have served, with military PTSD. 

Second of all, since I know it's a pretty sensitive subject (or at least i think it is) i rather use my secondary account rather than my main one.


Now, to my little issue... there's this mini series on YouTube (I live in Israel BTW) that basically everything episodes is around a different topic (like for instance past drug addicts, old people, people with mental health issues, blind people, LGBTQ+... you get the point) and they bring several people who deal with the certain topic that is discussed, and they give them questions to answer from the public that generally are ""taboo"" questions, or uncomfortable questions, or questions you're afraid to ask cuz it might cause some backlash etc... they have only 2 episodes from what I've seen surrounding mental health and the other one is about military PTSD. 

Now what irks me... is that this isn't the only time I notice people talking about PTSD regarding military, but they don't talk about other kinds of PTSD. I feel like that invalidates my own pain and suffering, I've been told several times ""you can't have PTSD unless you served in the military blah blah blah"" and such... again I don't mean to offend those who were have PTSD from serving in the military, I could never do that, and they do protect their country and are very brave (I personally think it's a bit silly that still in 2020 there are wars growing on and there still a lot of hate between people in general,  know what I mean? Like can'tthere be SOME peace, where we can actually focus on what matters, like global warming? Homeless people? Starvation?...)

But I hate how some people still to this day  are blind to the fact the ANYONE can have PTSD regardless of military service... yes there is more awareness and such, but sometimes I can't help but feel like sometimes the media and the public just don't take this seriously... does anyone agree or feels like this too? Even in class (I'm studying therapy dog training) when we talk about working with people who have PTSD they always focus on the military PTSD, and it just rubs me the wrong way.... I hope if you read this far you understand what I'm trying to say... I really hope I'm not offending anyone, or invalidating anyone, that's the LAST thing I'd wanna do..."
ptsd,Enigmus222,2020/2/28,"Is this PTSD? In late 2017 I had an absolutely terrifying comedown from MDMA. I was given far too much for a first time user and although having an enjoyable experience on the drug, I experienced 4-5 days of constant panic and anxiety that led to me thinking I was about to die and rushing to hospital. At the end of the experience, it was like I was looking at the world through a glass pane. I now know this is derealization. That glass pane has been there ever since.

I also experience bouts of extreme anger and rage, mood swings and difficulty concentrating without coffee. I also wake up 2-3 times during the night. 

I am not ""depressed"", as I have lots of energy, normal appetite. I would not even describe my feeling as low mood or sadness, I just feel very ""uncomfortable"" as if I need to sleep for 30 days and wake up to feel normal.

I feel a constant sense of unease, and find it impossible to feel truly calm/relaxed even for one second. I get random muscle twitches almost as if my sympathetic nervous system is constantly firing.

I do not experience flashbacks or nightmares, although for the first month or so I did have nighmares of taking the drug again. I think this may be because i did not consciously see it as a trauma in the same way as being in a battle etc.

I believe my brain has reacted in the same way as someone who was having real panic attacks for 4-5 days straight in a life-threatening situation."
ptsd,sweetsandia,2020/1/9,"ALL medical professionals should be required extensive training on PTSD Just a rant. Its long.

Malware is software written specifically to harm and infect the host system. PTSD is the malware infecting my system and FEAR is the virus that wrecks havoc.

So I have been triggered and my symptoms take over my entire being.
I have 3 options

Flee
Freeze?
Or Fight?

These are the ONLY options fear will give me, suddenly a harmless and simple situation? has turned into a battle for my survival. And yes, to me, its as dire as it sounds. So my logic and reason programming has been overridden -its not gone, its still running, but its only running at minimum so the virus can feed off the program and piggy back on the signal to proceed with the virus¡¯ own programming.

So I am faced with the three options mentioned above. What do they look like?

Flee- Literally leave the situation in any way I can. Seeing as the logic and reason programming is still running albeit at a limitation, I can process enough information from my environment to look for an immediate exit and follow through with fleeing from the situation. Analyzing my environment for an exit is about the only way I can use the logic and reason program that is still running. And this is an immediate reaction, either i phsically leave my environment ASAP or make arrangements and overcoming necessary hurdles to leave. The way I flee is dependant on the trigger that accessed the survival instinct. And the severity of my reaction to flee is also dependant on said specific trigger. No matter what I'm doing or what's going on, when I'm triggered it's time to flee.


Fight- So my fear of my survival has been activated (essentially, my logic and reason program has been infected with the malicious code FEAR) and my logic and reason programming is running at a minimum. I¡¯ve already scanned and processed the option to leave but I have come to the conclusion that fleeing is not an option. Meaning my exits in my environment are blocked or there are people who are blocking my exits. For my reaction to be extreme enough to want to fight, the people blocking my only exits must be some type of authority. For example, police officers, EMTs, or any type of medical professionals. My understanding is? that these people are the only people who can act on their authority at will with or without good intent. In civil society, these people are considered as necessary and these people are supposed to hold good intent. I am recounting VIVIDLY how each and everyone of these so called ¡°authority with good intent¡± VIOLATED me. Physically and psychologically. Seeing as I don't want to relive said horrible experiences again I consider theses authorities as ENEMIES to my survival whenever I see them when my survival instinct has been severely triggered. I will FIGHT these authorities. I will flail and scream and cry and do whatever makes them feel uncomfortable by being naked or screeching and howling when they touch me.? And it seems like, in my experience, these authorities do not have the faculties or understanding to not not treat me like an animal. I mean in all of my recounted experiences of cops, EMTs and nurses they exacerbated my symptoms by physically hurting me and demeaning me. Remember my logic and reason program is still running in the background so i¡¯m still aware of what¡¯s being said to me, how they are touching me, how they handle me and what emotions they evoke when they demean me. Plus im cogiscent enough to realize, causing injury to said authorities is a metaphorical DEATH SENTENCE. I don't want to go to jail or be arrested, or treated like a dangerous and malicious mentally ill person, so I am cognizant enough not to cause injury to others- I'm just SCARED and I CRY. Do these professionals really think I¡¯m a danger to them when I¡¯m naked and? bawling and screeching about being raped and that I don't want to be touched without care? Don¡¯t I have a right to say ¡°don't touch me¡± during perineal care yet said medical professionals disregard my repeated requests? Rendering me even more panicked about being in the ER? They think im insane. Well THEY are the ones who are insane with reasoning that extreme measures of restraint, ridicule and deliberate touching of my clitoris is the only way to treat a frightened, crying, naked young woman. Who let these people be medical professionals? And they get to live their lives thinking they did nothing wrong while I SUFFER .I¡¯m reliving these memories to the point of not functioning due to the extreme anxiety that these memories induce. I have PTSD from my experience at the ER. PTSD that is being treated with the help of my primary doctor. Who btw, I can barely see because he triggers such horrible feelings and memories.?

Medical professionals are suppose to be a beacon of hope, but instead they are psychological abusers. When it comes to psychological trauma, it's like all their training goes out the window and I'm just some animal. These medical professionals should not be? allowed to wantonly explain away their cruelty and the robbing of my humanity with a phrase of ¡°that just my job.¡± yet I have no name of the woman who touched my clitoris deliberately while providing perineal care. I don't even recall if she was an RN or CNA. But the restraints? Those were uncalled for and I¡¯m going to have to live with that trauma for the rest of my life.?

Freeze: knowing I cant fight or flee my body and brain just shuts down. I'm immobile, incapable of normal interaction. I'm still cognizant of what's around me but I'm being forced to watch the memories like some sick psycho is tying my down to a chair and forcing horrible movies about my life. I'm shivering, holding back tears gripping whatever is in my hand with dear life. Just visible distressed and immobile.

Every single one of these reactions are EMBARRASSING and SHAMEFUL in polite society. I'm no longer worthy to exist because people just dont understand what trauma does to a person."
ptsd,WisteriaSuperAlex10,2020/2/14,"Self re-post from r/CPTSD: My trauma story [triggering] Hi I'm Alex, I just joined Reddit and created my account because of this subreddit I just discovered and because of a post I saw here, called 'Anyone here living your teen years later?'. 


I am a European 21-year-old young man (born 1998) and Spanish is my mother tongue, but besides that I don't know who I am anymore. My ""father"" (I don't see him as such), an absolute narcissist and GBV abuser, has economically, judicially, emotionally and socially abused me for half my life. Meanwhile, my mother, a GBV survivor woman, has also abused me as a consequence of her not receiving help and support and therapy herself. She is sick and I am basically the only person she has, since she herself was born also in a hyperdisfunctional, abusive, toxic family. 

I've been parentified (instrumentally and emotionally), isolated for years (having NO social life nor even Internet at home, in my high school years), economically chained to perpetual poverty, fallen into several mental circumstances (reactive high-functioning depression, anxiety and Atlas personality, people pleasing disorder and boundaries issues, undiagnosed C-PTSD (complex PTSD), emotional instability, disconnection from the self, limerence and OCD-like behaviours, suicidal tendencies, sleeping disorders, exhaustion, memory disorders, etc) and I've been extremely broken and in survival mode for all my teen and pre-teen years, arguably a decade, and I can't hold on any longer. Also, my mother and I may get evicted this 2020 and this 2020 I must do my university thesis. And I have just like 100000000000 needs unmet hahaha. I really can't.

A lot of my relationships have been challenged by me suddenly questioning the entire relationship because they triggered something related to my trauma. It can be an opinion or belief they hold that reminds me of my abuser and suddenly it can trigger a panic and then I need time to reflect.

A lot of people will resent me for doing this though and become quite nasty to me for suddenly withdrawing and will say cruel things about me or to me.

It doesn't make any sense to me why people always seem to kick you while you're already down. Sometimes when I work up the courage to return to a relationship that they've complained and complained I've abandoned... they try to change the narrative. I want to explain my trauma and my thought process and communicate... but they want to reverse the roles and become the one to abandon or reject me. It feels so humiliating and premeditated.

It's   basically a scientology cult that denies the existence of mental   illness and anything that has to do with psychology and psychiatry.   Things like these could greatly affect us. Some people need help out   there and they just oppose it. It's sick.

This subreddit: [r/antipsychiatry](https://www.reddit.com/r/antipsychiatry/) describes it.

Are they just schizophrenics who are unmedicated or what?? Because  the most common symptom of schizophrenia is usually DENIAL.

I  suffer from schizophrenia and I find it offensive for me and everybody  else affected with mental illness. Because they say it's all a myth.

Imagine  if a person with schizophrenia or any delusional disorder actually  believes them and stops or won't take treatment at all, it can harm him  and the people around him. This is very serious. Or what if someone is  suicidal and needs help? This can cause a lot of damage people.

I am trying to spread this on many mental health communities because maybe something can be achieved.

Have   you ever heard about cases where people died because they were  following  their conspiracy cure instead of having a real medical care?  Whether it was a cancer cure or whatever. Similar things can happen  here!

ptsd,ocean_wavez,2020/4/13,"Help with constant fear of something bad happening Hello everyone. I have been experiencing worsening PTSD symptoms after a recent traumatic time when a family member of mine almost died. They are doing very well now and are mostly healed. My main problem is constantly thinking something bad is happening or going to happen. I am quarantined at home with my parents right now, and every time my mom's phone rings I think it's someone calling to say my family member has been hurt or died; whenever I hear my dog's toy squeak from another room I think it's my mom screaming or crying after finding out horrible news; I'm even having trouble sleeping thinking that any minute my mom will wake me up to tell me my family member is hurt or died. I think the stress is mainly around my mom because she is the one that found out the news about my family member the first time and I witnessed her horrifying reaction (screaming and crying) then, so my mind jumps to that happening again.

 It's like any possible way that something can be interpreted as something bad happening, my brain interprets it that way. Does anyone else have this problem, and how do you cope with it? I am not asking for medical advice, just ways that people have coped with this problem before. This is very distressing to me and I have an appointment with a counselor on Friday but would like some advice about what to do until then."

ptsd,MovingCouchT,2020/3/5,Can PTSD with dissociative features turn into schizophrenia? I hope not.
ptsd,greenwitchery,2020/3/14,"Triggered by yelling I'm an adult living with my parents. I have a good relationship with them, but my step-dad can be very loud occasionally when he is frustrated about something or when he is telling a story. He has startled me and made me jump before when yelling at the dogs for their bad behavior. Anyway today he came home complaining about how people were acting at the store over all this coronavirus stuff (fair enough), but he got really worked up telling the story and described a fight he saw, basically yelling the story at me. 

I immediately tensed up, kind of disassociated and got quiet in hopes to just end the conversation. The conversation did end, very awkwardly. I couldn't explain to him that his tone and demeanor was scaring me, because I did not want to go into that. 

I used to think my PTSD came from my more recent unhealthy relationships, but I have done a lot of healing to work through those and have a pretty positive perspective on developing future relationships. However, I still have PTSD triggers that come up here and there. The only thing I can think is that when I was growing I felt that he secretly disliked me or judged me, and at my dad's house, my step-mom was outwardly judgmental towards anything I said or did, so I was afraid to stir the pot. I stayed very quiet and calm, in order to avoid confrontation. It felt like trying to avoid stepping on a bomb, like tension was building and it could explode at any moment. There were moments here and there where it did explode. Even though those moments were few and far between, they stuck with me and kept me in a fearful place. 

Even now, I have this fear that he secretly hates me and wants me to leave. I constantly wonder if this is my own insecurity or if I am picking up on a real feeling he does not want to admit. Anyway, getting pretty deep into the rabbit hole of my brain. I just wanted to vent about this. This feels like such a small, stupid trigger, but it made me realize how much fear I still harbor.

Diagnosed PTSD several times over due to a traumatic injury, a miscarriage at 5 months, rape, domestic violence, and childhood abuse. I know my triggers, and I have worked my ass off to control them and heal myself as much as I could. 

More recently (the past 18) I have been stalked by a community volunteer I used to mentor, threatened, and physically assaulted. After all this, my best friend of several years used intimate knowledge of my normally controlled triggers (and happily shared them with coworkers) to harass me until I was suicidal... then made sure I was fired for being so from my job of TEN years.

I'm trying desperately to figure out how I could live through so much and be just absolutely annihilated by recent events... am I just too damaged? Did it all get to be too much? Is ANY bit of strength I had just gone? I have been dealing with this for so many years, and I am really struggling to understand how lost and broken I am right now.

ptsd,Palpatingpickles,2020/1/23,"Return to work after career damaged by PTSD (potential TW) Hi all, 

Figure I'll start with a bit of background, and go into my query from there. 

Two years ago, I was diagnosed with PTSD due to my employment. My work involved animals, and my condition evolved from the conflict between my duties and my own sense of personal ethics and morals. Over time, I entered into deeper and deeper cycles of depressions, anxiety and associated factors such as suicidal ideation and auditory sensitivity. 

Then, BAM, I fell into full blown PTSD (hyper-vigilance, nightmares, memory recall, the lot). At the time it happened I was terrified and had no idea what was happening. After a visit to my second  psychologist (the first was terrible), I was formally diagnosed with PTSD under the DSM-5 criteria. This diagnosis was later confirmed by a psychiatrist and a psychologist assigned to my worker's compensation case. 

Due to the condition, and the associated horrors which go along with it, I had no choice but to leave my job entirely. My primary duties were obviously major triggers for me, and even associated tasks (such as administration duties) became significantly troubling. 

I'm on the path to recovery using a combination of CBT and EMDR to deal with symptoms and the root source of my PTSD, and I'm showing signs of progress. I'm still ups and downs, but I'm generally feeling good enough to start being a functioning member of society again (or so I think). In saying that, I've no idea how.

My old career, which I had spent twelve years building is gone. Education, training, experience, all of it. Alternate employment within my field (conservation, biology and zoology) is not an option, as it would involve interaction with equipment and environments which act as major triggers for me. 

So, a complete career change it has to be. I have enough skills in administration and data management to cope, and people skills to boot (including presentation experience). However, no matter what I do I feel like a fraud. I feel like I'm not good enough or skilled enough to gain employment in any other field but what I've known. Hell, half the time I barely even feel human.

I'm also terrified of returning to work in case it hurts me again (as my former position has). 

So, here's my question. For those of you who've managed a career switch (or just re-employment) after suffering from PTSD, how did you do it? Did you go out and completely re-train? Or did you simply re-organise your existing skill-set and apply for roles which were significantly different from your old ones? And, once you started working again, did it help you feel more human? Or was it just added strain on top of your recovery? 

I'm really interested to know, and would like to hear from you. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Spent twelve years working a career which led to the development of PTSD. Education, training and experience are all but useless now as any closely associated career would likely act as a trigger. Currently in recovery, and looking at part-time work to make myself feel more human. 

Wondering how other PTSD survivors came back from their condition to find employment, how they did it, and if it helped them."
ptsd,zachbraffsipod,2020/1/28,"Repressed memories or psychosis? So I had my first and only intense psychotic episode last summer. Not too long afterwards I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder though this was decided purely upon symptoms I¡¯d been displaying, no meeting with any professionals to go through my history/background, etc, which seemed odd to me. Something that came up during the episode was a distressing childhood memory that I hadn¡¯t thought about in a very long time or, in fact, ever put much thought into before. So I was getting flashbacks, visions, panic attacks, and bodily discomfort/pain in certain areas. But all of this was glossed over and I didn¡¯t tell any doctors since, well, they didn¡¯t ask - they were too busy trying to medicate me. So i¡¯ve been distancing myself from the possibility of PTSD ever since. It was only today (5 months on) that I met with a psychologist for an evaluation of my past / what kind of help will be available to me (which is only art therapy at the moment...) and digging things up felt good in the moment as it was nice to be heard. But I didn¡¯t touch upon the childhood memory. When I got
home I started to think about it again and began to sob, shake and heart rate shot up - the only way to calm down was to dissociate, so that¡¯s where I¡¯m at now (though obviously ive detached myself enough to think / write about it). 

Should I speak up about this more? I¡¯m just so afraid of being shut down. But I¡¯m not sure what kind of answers im looking for. Its possible that the session today just overwhelmed me and I¡¯m feeling lots of emotions right now. I guess I¡¯m thinking that maybe it was unfair of them to diagnose me with bipolar without validating my memories since the entire thing was seemingly based on this psychotic episode I had that was triggered by circumstantial stress - but some of the things I was saying were true, and I think they may have overlooked those things intentionally since I¡¯m a ¡°complex case¡±, as one doctor put it.

I feel like if i bring things up they¡¯ll only offer me more mind-numbing meds even though i¡¯m not currently in a psychotic episode. Since the diagnosis was so thinly researched I¡¯m almost certain there¡¯s atleast one other condition overlapping. Especially as my current treatment doesn¡¯t seem to be altering very much. Big sigh."
ptsd,Renegade-Philosopher,2020/4/13,"I have a family that denies my PTSD I've had PTSD for a couple years now, and I'd be considered in my teenage years.

ptsd,Vast-Macaroon,2020/1/14,"unwanted sexual arousal and masturbation (CW: sexual assault) Hello, I had a therapy session yesterday and when my therapist asked me about trauma that happened, I felt my whole body sort of stiffen and become tense, I started to cry and I instantly became aroused. I felt super uncomfortable and adjusted my sitting to try to stop the feeling, which kind of helped but I still felt very strange. I noticed this happened to me twice during that session when I thought about what happened. 

Last night, I also noticed this when I was trying to masturbate to help myself fall asleep.  I masturbate a lot because my sex drive is insatiably high lately or I'm just using it as a stress reliever, but when I masturbate a certain way I feel absolutely awful. Even doing it by touching different parts, which feels way more pleasurable for me, usually still makes me feel guilty, because I don't like ""normal"" pleasure as much as I should. 

Anyway I'm at home now and thoughts came back, and I became very sexually aroused. I hate it because what happened was not arousing at all, and I was too young to know anything about sex/masturbation when it happened. The worst part is I actually enjoy the feelings of arousal as much as I'm uncomfortable and don't want them to happen. And I hate the idea that what happened was arousing, because it wasn't at all. My usual sexual fantasies are similar in that I'm almost always being used by someone, but they're more gentle and about care/love, and not about being humiliated or hurt. 

I sort of want to masturbate and kill the urge, but I'm afraid I'll feel incredibly badly afterwards, so I think I'm going to try to ignore it. Is that the right thing to do or should I satisfy that urge? I really don't know what to do. My next therapy session is in 2 weeks and I don't know if I'll bring this up, I feel very embarrassed about it. I don't have anyone I can tell this to(at least not for 2 weeks), so I wanted to post here &amp; see if someone had suggestions to stop feeling like this. Thank you"

ptsd,GoldCosmos,2020/2/5,"How can I better understand and help my girlfriend who has trauma/PTSD I (23M) have recently got into a relationship with someone (21F) and was looking for some advice from this community for how to better understand and help her with what she¡¯s going through.

For context: about 18 months ago she was physically assaulted by a friend, we¡¯ve known each other a couple of months and she¡¯s been slowly opening up, bit by bit, with what happened. She¡¯s said things like ¡®you have no idea what it¡¯s like, thinking you¡¯re going to die there and then¡¯, things like this.

From my perspective, I¡¯ve been struggling with depression for the last 3-4 years and most of the advice I feel I can give is very centred around the struggles I¡¯ve had. The problem of course is that she is suffering from trauma from a very specific event; I¡¯ve talked through things like ¡®you¡¯re safe now¡¯, ¡®surrounded by love¡¯, ¡®you can come out of it stronger¡¯ etc and all of this ¡®bigger picture¡¯ sort of stuff, which she has pretty much dealt with... but the person who assaulted her is still living in the same city as us and she will occasionally see her and be thrown right back into how she felt in the moment and have a panic attack. 

She¡¯s gone through a free counselling service already which hasn¡¯t helped her, just picks at wounds and puts her right back in the moment, so she¡¯s panics. She feels like she¡¯s not being taken seriously and that nobody understands her. I just want to help and do what I can. 

To cut to the chase, what I¡¯m asking is:
1). How can I better understand what it¡¯s like to experience trauma, PTSD etc, coming from someone who has virtually never encountered/experienced it? 
2). How can I help with that very specific trauma, what worked for you, what help is out there?? Etc."

ptsd,dazedandconfused820,2020/2/5,"TW!!!: I¡¯m worried that I made my sister believe she was sexually abused. Growing up, I¡¯ve had terrible flashbacks involving my babysitter touching me and forcing me to touch him as well. I¡¯ve been sexually abused by my babysitter for a year when I was 6. I always ignored these flashbacks, and felt guilty for remembering them, thinking that I made them up and was dirty for seeing those ¡°images¡± at such a young age. It wasn¡¯t until middle school when I finally confronted these thoughts, and acknowledged them for what they were. I¡¯ve been diagnosed with severe ptsd. It¡¯s gotten to a point where I have to sleep with the lights on, avoid touch at all costs, and shower clothed. I¡¯ve had numerous dreams where I was raped, had panic attacks because I thought my babysitter was coming back, and have been hospitalized for self-harming. The reason I¡¯m saying all this is to confirm that this was very real to me, and I, like every other ptsd victim, suffer from numerous symptoms as a result. 

When I was first trying to figure this out, I seeked confirmation from my sister, hoping that I wasn¡¯t the only one experiencing these flashbacks. I felt so guilty and dirty from thinking these thoughts that I seeked solidarity from my siblings where there wasn¡¯t any. I asked her if she had remembered anything regarding the babysitter, and told her that she might¡¯ve experienced the same thing. She said she didn¡¯t remember anything regarding that, but she immediately jumped to the conclusion that she was abused as a child despite remembering absolutely nothing about it. I felt guilty, because I thought that I had implanted false memories into her. I fully believe that she would¡¯ve never ever believed that she¡¯d been sexually abused if I hadn¡¯t told her that there was a possibility that she had been a part of it. 

I¡¯m aware that you guys might argue that she could have repressed the memory, but there are almost no psychological studies that support this. Repression is controversial because trauma is shown to enhance memory, not actively repress it. Trauma haunts you, that¡¯s why it¡¯s so damaging and concerning. Trauma isn¡¯t something you could forget. Cognitively speaking, victims can forget crucial details to the trauma but will remember the main event as well as the emotions they felt at the time. If you don¡¯t agree with this statement, which I respect, here¡¯s my suggestion if her memories were truly repressed: if someone had repressed these memories, they would still be affected by symptoms of ptsd, or underlying fears. My sister had none of that. She was able to walk into the room where the abuse took place completely unaffected. Doesn¡¯t suffer from any nightmares, flashbacks, or ptsd symptoms regarding the trauma. Is perfectly comfortable with intimacy and tough.  And hasn¡¯t been medically diagnosed with any mental disorder. 

I¡¯m not saying this didn¡¯t happen to her, since there¡¯s really no way anyone could fully know what my babysitter had done. However, I still do feel guilty for sharing this with her. By telling her my trauma, I¡¯m worried that I made her carry a weight that she shouldn¡¯t have had to carry. Admittedly, there¡¯s also this terrible, mean side to me that just feels angry. I know this isn¡¯t right, and most of this is admittedly due to my own bias and emotions. I feel upset that I¡¯ve come out so fucked up after what happened to me. I still feel as if I¡¯m in constant danger even though this has happened years ago. I¡¯ve experienced backlash from my parents, who thought I was possessed by a demon when I was simply just mentally ill. I broke up with my girlfriend because I felt sick everytime I touched her. 

Every aspect of my life feels chained to this trauma and to know that my sister believes she has been through the same thing, pisses me off. She has never experienced the problems I had, or even anything to do with ptsd. Most of her problems are social, and have nothing to do with fear of the past coming back to her. This anger, of course, isn¡¯t righteous at all, and isn¡¯t meant to demean anything she could¡¯ve possibly been through. It¡¯s just this anger I feel from her believing it has happened to her without even remembering or appearing even remotely affected by it. I feel guilty for telling her, I feel angry for reasons that I personally need to work on, and I feel guilty for feeling angry. 

I¡¯ve tried to communicate with her about this but she is, reasonably enough, very defensive about it, claiming that she couldn¡¯t remember anything or or have any symptoms because she had repressed them (which, as I¡¯ve stated before, isn¡¯t a solid argument). Because of this, I don¡¯t plan to talk with her about this again. I just really need advice on how to cope with these feelings of guilt and anger, or to stop feeling this way about what I had done. 

There¡¯s also a possibility that I am simply being selfish and in denial as well, so keep that in mind as well. I could also just be angry that she wasn¡¯t as affected by what happened in comparison. I¡¯m sorry if I appear rude or bigoted for saying all this. I¡¯ve tried to ignore this cloying feeling but I just can¡¯t. 

TLDR!!: I suffer from severe ptsd after being sexually abused by my babysitter. To confirm my flashbacks, because I was worried they were fake, I told my sister there was a possibility she had experienced the same thing and asked if she remembered anything. She didn¡¯t remember anything, and has not experienced any flashbacks, nightmares, or anxiety regarding the trauma. However, after I told her that, she immediately believed she was abused even though she had no recollection or symptoms from it (she¡¯s also the type to self-diagnose). How do I stop feeling guilty and angry about this?

Also had to be treated for congenital curvature, lichen sclerosis and eventually circumcised. It anger me that i can't get it back no matter what, feel like pathetic, lame, unsexy, less of a man and contributes to my self hate and embarrassment as if i haven't suffered enough whilst the bullies get off unpunished. College was much the same but i really struggled with studying and social interactions. i have extreme ptsd, social anxiety and depression, i developed a stutter and mumble most of my sentences, speaking extremely fast just wanting to get to the end. I was extremely nervous and would make obvious mistakes brought on by poor working memory and fear of bullying by my peers. I was harassed every interaction with 3 students who made my life hell. Jumped on everything i said and mocked it, pretent to be friendly but getting off on making me uncomfortable, get in my face to make my flinch, find me and aggressively ask me questions about my self ad hobbies just out of pure sadism, trying to find something to mock. And met my old bully (the ringleader) in the same class. i ended up skipping mos of the last few classes. So i left with no qualifications. I have been on welfare for a long time and after becoming suicidal was admitted to a clinic. The doctors and nurses were awful. Extremely unempathetic, condescending and disconnected, just dishing out mandatory cookie cutter advice never anything else. Managed to get out just by ticking the boxes which was humiliating to go through. I have been living with my parents all this time feeling like a parasite/leech. Desperately trying to get my life on track. It angers me to see my bullies successful whilst i have crippling social anxiety/ depression/ ptsd. My bullies are a sous Chef, Architect and have girlfriends. Sorry for the long post just really needed someone to talk to. i read journaling helps and talking to people that are in a similar situation to me makes me feel like i'm not alone. Thanks for listening."
ptsd,Vipin_Mo,2020/2/9,"NSFW Back at square one, feeling lost. Just a warning that this post deals with triggering and graphic subjects! 


Hey, I'm 16 and have been dealing with PTSD since 2014 and just recently relived a very similar event and caused me to lose all my progress. Feeling lost and have no clue what to do anymore.

Back in 2014 on christmas eve I saw a man get shot and killed while shopping for a ring for my mother. I was about 11 or 12 at the time and just didn't really know how to cope or understand it so I blocked it out until around 2017 when I accepted the fact that I did/do have PTSD and tried to acknowledge and work with it more. Before then I had been diagnosed with PTSD twice but chose to ignore it, even though I would constantly have nightmares and dealt with pretty bad insomnia along with paranoia. 

I'm currently in a tiny RV park in the fucking desert and just recently had to listen to a guy getting shot to death two RVs down from my own. It destroyed any progress I had previously made and I don't even know where to go from here anymore. Ever since then I've been waking up at 2-3am because of nightmares, I constantly feel so fucking numb and on edge, it's fucking terrible. His RV is still right there and everyday I look out the window and just see it there. I feel guilty for being so affected by it because my dad saw the body and is holding it together, I can't imagine how the victim's family feels.

I can't even remember how I really started to recover from the first event, I understand that the recent event is still extremely fresh but I just hate that I have to do this all over again. Life will be life, though. Shit happens and people are still just as cruel and senseless as they've always been.
 There's many more aspects to the murder that I'm scared to open up about that are also causing me issues but all I can say is that the victim won't get justice, the system in the tiny town I'm at is fucked and corrupted. 


I just really needed a place to let this out at for now until I am able to figure out whatever else I can do to help myself. As much as I hate it, I think I'll have to just give myself time."
ptsd,Valsana,2020/3/26,"Hi, I just have a small question for those who have ptsd that I hope isn't going to be upsetting for anyone. I've been trying to help a friend and don't know what is happening anymore and ptsd seems to be the only reason I can think of Hi. I'm just going to put anything I think my upset someone in a spoiler tag, so dw bout not reading it.

Basically, over a year ago my friend had to try support his friend through &gt;!selfharm, and it was a serious situation as the guy had been diagnosed with depression!&lt; and from what he says it was really heartbreaking and stressful. His mood went down dramatically and he started losing it with everyone as well as himself. So eventually he lost all his friends expect me and my bestfriend, which resulted from his outbursts from all the worry he had(the other friends were just arrogant bullies so personally believe hes better off without them) . Like, my friend I'm pretty certain had depression or an illness with similar symptoms at that time. Like, when it all combined he was telling me that he hates me because i never help him and, it obviously the stress getting to him so I knew to just let him vent and reassure him that I love him like family.

But thing now is, he never goes a day without mentioning something related to those 2 things. Like if he sees one of the old friends he will get really angry, nearly start crying and starts talking about how they all fucked him over. Thing is, he has every right to be mad, but the way he reacts is not normal, just seeing them or mentioning someone with the shared first name will set him off. Like I love him, so I'm good with supporting him, though not going to lie, I'm a prick and really aren't the nicest and he knows that I am but still stays friends with me over alot of his old friends, so I imagine his old friends had to be very nasty pieces of work if he considers me nice.

In regards to that and the &gt;!self harm!&lt;, he told me that its always been in his head. So from when all this started, in total thats like almost 3 years. And he got bullied alot (people assuming hes gay, being told to &gt;!self harm or kill himself!&lt;, everyone hates him) daily. It was bad. Like he compares it to someone with a hearing issue having a constant ringing in their hear. It never goes away. So I think its like constantly replaying in his head.

I love him so much and just want to try find a way to help him with this. He doesn't want to talk to anyone about it because he thinks he'll drag us down(since him helping a person with mental illness is one of the reasons). I also try to get him to consider talking to a doctor, but money is a problem.

Also since then he experiences panic attacks and I suspect &gt;!self harm!&lt; because I noticed he has &gt;!scars!&lt;. Like its really scary how much that affected him, the guy also told him at one point &gt;!""I like hurting myself because of you!&lt;

I know thats a mess, but does any of that seem similar to what you experienced? Im only asking here because ptsd is the only thing that seems like a possible reason. But its also mainly emotional truama so I dont know if here is the right place to ask."
ptsd,AltruisticEmergency4,2020/2/2,"How to balance managing triggers/stimuli and living a normal life Hey everyone how's it going this is my first post. In fact I only registered to make this post.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't think a lot about PTSD until a year or two ago when I just sorta got hit full force with something I didn't understand. As a man I was raised not to be a wimp and cry about my feelings and told to just suck it up and that's life and life isn't fair and all that other shit. I thought that's all well and good I'll just do what dad does and drink a few beers and watch TV and ignore everything. That worked okay for a few years, although I was really struggling mentally during that time, but then the wheels just came off at some point where I was too messed up in the brain to operate normally in society.

&amp;#x200B;

I would get these nightmares that were so bad that they wanted to use me as an experiment for a new drug that's being trialed for use by the U.S. Military. I forget what it's called but essentially it's this blood pressure medication, but when you take it you never dream again for the rest of your life. I mean these nightmares were so insane I actually thought I might be possessed by a demon and considered seeking help from a priest.

&amp;#x200B;

I would get this anxiety that got so bad that I could not turn my back to someone or all this other weird shit. I'd always sit in a restaurant in a booth or chair with my back to the wall so I could see the whole restaurant and everyone in it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd also wake up in the morning looking like I had just been run over by a truck, but all I had done was sleep in my bed and have nightmares. I'd have insane wounds on my body that I could not explain. A lot of super bad bruises, cuts, what looked like road rash and other stuff like that. Some medical student I know said I might have been hurting myself in my sleep, but this is still unsolved really.

&amp;#x200B;

I won't go through every last detail but what I'm getting at is that it got so strange and painful in such a short period of time and I had no idea where it was coming from. It was like I was being poisoned surreptitiously or something. I thought I was a tough guy but this was like physiological in nature. It made me so sick sometimes that I'd puke for days and not be able to sleep and I'd get dehydrated and have to go to the ER and get saline and a MRI.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually I went to some therapist because I thought I had an anxiety disorder or something, but they were like no you got PTSD. I didn't believe it at the time, I was like ""yeah right"", because when I think of PTSD I think of like Apocalypse Now or something. As my condition and relationships with others has deteriorated I've come around to the line of thought that maybe I do have some form of PTSD.

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen or been a part of a lot of different things over my life that snowballed together, but the core of that snowball is a lot of child abuse stuff. I'm not going to flesh it all out because I don't want to trigger a lot of people. However, with my drug addict family a lot of the stories here of paramedics or cops resonate with me strangely because I've seen a lot of nasty stuff in that arena although I wasn't forced to do it as a profession it just occurred where I live. I also worked in the pseudo-capacity of an apartment building manager when I was still a teenager so I had to &gt;!go to the building when people had committed suicide via rifle to the face and they were still doing CSI shit and taking photographs and find someone to clean up the blood/brain/skull/hair after the cops took the body away.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

I got sent to some place when I was a kid for drinking and taking Oxycodone because I wanted to kill myself because of the shit I had to deal with every time I went home from school and just the general state of life which was super lonely and dark and filled with violence and just all that good stuff. The place they sent me to was called SageWalk which is owned by the Aspen Education Group which is owned by Bain Capital in turn. Essentially, it's a concentration camp worse than what the Jews were put in in WW2 and that is not an exaggeration whatsoever. The Jews in WW2 at least had beds and buildings to sleep in, but we didn't even get that. We had to sleep on the ground outside. I didn't shower or change my clothes for four months and got no medical care. We still had to do all the work of any given 1930s era German work camp and people were worked until they literally dropped dead on the floor, but probably got fed slightly better because of the common availability of United Nations Relief Agency-style Sysco foodstuffs in the modern day. People still got hurt and died all the time though and we got beaten and abused by guards with weapons and were never allowed to leave even though we had committed no crime. You were also taken there by guys with guns who would like punch you in the stomach and laugh as you wheeze over, like they don't really see you as a human being. It was really not that much different from the Holocaust except it was targeted at kids with bad grades instead of Jews. I haven't even really touched on the stuff they did there, but you get the basic jist. It was such an extreme isolation though that over the course of however many months I forgot about chairs/cars etc existing. I only remembered airplanes existed when a Piper Cub flew low one day doing some pilot training. Strange yet true.

&amp;#x200B;

They operate as a pseudo-mafia enterprise like Scientology and it's very cult-like, so if you go against them or petition the Department of Human Services or whoever they'll just have Bain Capital file a lawsuit and shut it all down before it even gets off the ground. They eventually couldn't cover up this one murder they did so the FBI came in and closed the place, but they just reopened 6 new ones in different states with slightly different names. Everyone that works there also uses fake names so they can't be identified in court to be prosecuted.

&amp;#x200B;

They forced me to stop using my real name and punished me whenever I did. I had to use some made-up cult name they gave me and call everyone else by their cult name. They made us do rituals which were traumatic, at least to me. I'd get woken up by some guy at like 5 A.M. and he would put his hand over my mouth and gesture for me to not speak or make a sound no matter what. He was like the High Priest and he would take me along with a few other acolytes to the top of this hill that was flat at the top like a plateau. Also with me were others that were like me. On top of this plateau were sigils and Freemasonic type symbols either carved into the earth or made out of rocks that were laid out to make such a pattern. I don't remember all of it but we called on the spirits of the cardinal directions and the old gods to come forth and aid us. Then we did this incantation thing to praise the sun as it rose and there was a lot of screaming and yelling where they'd get in your face and like move incense over you. It was pretty much Satanic Ritual Abuse, which people don't even think is real, but I was forced to do it or else I'd be starved and thrown to the ground over and over. Many other people will corroborate my story.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of people say that once you break someone down mentally (like some ""creative"" interrogation or whatever) they never recover. This is a concept I'm only becoming aware of now.

&amp;#x200B;

My main problem is with triggers. In fact, it got so bad that I had to quit my job six months ago and I've been out of work since then and barely left my house in all that time in order to avoid triggers/stimuli. Inside here I control the environment, out there I have no control there are others who are in control. Out there I have no power to stop the same thing from happening to me again, but in here I can just shoot anyone that comes in the door. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can go through my day totally normal and then smell a certain type of burning wood and then it just flips a switch. The only problem is it's not just the smell of a certain type of burning wood, but so many different things that are so mundane that there's no way to avoid them. Like certain bushes/trees and the presence of snow (I live in California so not much of it) can really put me into a bad mode. It's like a mode where it's total fight or flight and everyone on earth is my enemy and I'm not safe anywhere and if somebody grabs me by the arm or tries to put me in handcuffs I'd probably stab them to death. When I got kidnapped and taken to that place those guys with guns put me in handcuffs, so even if some cop nicely asks can I put cuffs on you while I search your car I'm just thinking in my mind not so good thoughts. Since as you cops say ""hands kill"" and to be totally bound and at someone's mercy with no way to defend yourself is not something I'm really into, especially after the last time it happened and I went through something not unlike going to Guantanamo Bay like with a black bag over my head and everything with guns to my head and people saying they'll kill me.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, these are obstacles to having a normal life with some degree of satisfaction or happiness in it. I would like to have a wife and kids, but I find it impossible to trust or be close to people. If I trust someone enough to tell them what I've just posted here they see me as broken and crazy and want nothing to do with me. So it's kind of a lose-lose situation and I've been on my own with this for about 13 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't stay in my house forever and never go outside again so what can I do to bring myself back into the fold when I hit one of those triggers? Even when I'm doped up on tranquilizers it doesn't always fully stop the rush of memories and sensations that come flooding into my soul. I know there's a lot of guys on here who have some sort of technique to keep them going, I just really need to know what it is.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for taking the time to listen to my little monologue. I hope you have a good day."
ptsd,missrosepetal,2020/2/24,"Is migration possibly traumatic? Hello,

I (23,female) moved from Bulgaria to Austria with my mom as I was 10 years old. Always been a shy/introvert child. Had to go to school one month after arriving, even though I didn't speak any german. I faced some mental health issues through puberty until now that were never treated and look for the cause, because I want to identify the problem and work on myself.

I never really considered moving the problem, because I use to handle it quite well. My grades didn't go down too much, I learned the language quite fast...but had no real friends until high school, had to switch schools once in middleschool too)

My question is, is moving from one country to another as a child considered traumatic? Do you guys have experiences with migration yourself?"
ptsd,bergerboi420,2020/2/17,"PTSD from another¡¯s experience Trigger warning for sexual content, BDSM, similarities with pedophilia, mention of parental abuse, mention of suicide

To give a little background, I (23F) was abused my by dad for the first 6 years of my life, physically and verbally. A family member mentioned something about possible sexual abuse, but this topic is very avoided by our family, so it¡¯s never discussed. 

My older brother (29) was seriously affected by the abuse he endured, and now has his own set of struggles and problems he faces as an adult. This includes uncontrollable anger, violence to his girlfriend, screaming, throwing things (anything from a mug to a dinner chair) around when things don¡¯t go his way, threatening suicide, and more. I lived with him and my mom for a few years like this and this caused me to be very sensitive to noise, particularly made by men. I don¡¯t live with them anymore. I have been afraid and wary of men for my whole life, and part of me wants to keep it that way for my safety even though I know it causes me a lot of pain in my every day of life.

Without getting too into details, my long distance girlfriend (22) visited a BDSM dungeon to learn what it was about and instantly had a 70 year old man infatuated with her. He invited her to his house to teach her, and I strongly discouraged her from going. After an impact play session at the dungeon and some time, she asked me if she could go to his house for more sessions because he wanted it so badly. We all agreed for it all to be nonsexual, no penetration, clothed, just impact play. 

This man consistently pushed the boundaries of what we were comfortable with. He would touch her in areas we said he couldn¡¯t, he always put our discussions about the sessions into a VERY sexual context, and he was extremely possessive of my girlfriend. He¡¯d deny all of this when we discussed it, citing his many many years of time in the BDSM scene making what he was doing okay and normal.

One of the sessions, I was getting so anxious for my girlfriend¡¯s safety, I asked if I could watch on video chat the whole time. I almost regret this, because watching that happen was absolutely horrible. I was holding back tears the whole time, I felt like I was going to throw up, and I did all I could to not completely freak out. I was shaking after the session and could barely speak, even though all I had done was watch. 

He continued to call the session a threesome that evening and that was the final straw for me. I already had an extreme aversion to the idea of sex with men, especially old men, and I couldn¡¯t handle that. I messaged my girlfriend that night that I wouldn¡¯t be able to watch any more of their sessions.

Some time passed, she had one or two more sessions with him (I tried to think about it as little as possible while it was going on so I wasn¡¯t keeping count), and my girlfriend moved for school in early fall. After a while, I believed that he was in the past and wouldn¡¯t be a problem again. Eventually, my girlfriend and I discussed this and she realized how creepy this situation actually was, and she felt extremely uncomfortable with how familiar this old man was with her body. We agreed that we shouldn¡¯t have contact with him anymore and she told him this politely in a text. We tried to move on together and leave this in the past.

And then he posted photos of her body on a BDSM website without her consent. She asked him to take it down, he refused. After a whole night of pleading him to take it down, we reported it and it disappeared. A couple days later, he posted it again. She got in contact with the dungeon she met him at, which he was actually longterm volunteer for, and they were able to get the photo down and promised my girlfriend they¡¯d keep an eye on his profile and that they¡¯d deal with his situation with the dungeon.

TLDR: Creepy 70 year old man consistently pushes my girlfriend¡¯s and my boundaries during BDSM impact play session and then posts photos of my gf¡¯s body in retaliation of my gf telling him she doesn¡¯t want him in her life anymore.

Now I have an extreme on-sight reaction to any old man even slightly similar to this man. I feel like I¡¯m going to collapse and cry and freak out the second I visually process an old man. The biggest problem is that I work at a drugstore and there are LOTS of old men who use the store. I¡¯m terrified of them and I don¡¯t know how long I can handle these extreme responses I have to seeing them. Nearly of my trauma related reactions have funneled into this and it¡¯s more extreme than anything I¡¯ve experienced before.

Thankfully, I will be started EMDR therapy soon, and I really really hope to see improvement one day. I think I might need to quit my job. I feel like I¡¯m going to die when I have to ring up an old man, I can barely speak to them and I can¡¯t look them in the eyes. I¡¯ve cried throughout typing this and I am so scared about going back to work every single day.

Does it make sense that my triggers and reactions changed so much just by this situation I didn¡¯t even experience firsthand?"

My parents purportedly did this because of discord in the home and to treat my dysthymia, but in reality they sent me away to fix me. 

Almost fifteen years later, I worked through community college and was accepted to a prestigious public school. Although my grades are objectively good, I experienced flashbacks and many emotional disturbances regularly that leave me as a panicked zombie for days. I have a psychiatrist and a therapist, but I avoid medications because of the side effects and because of their history being used as chemical restraints. In a strange way, it's like I was turned back into a teenager and sent away again and I'm here because I'm a failure. 

I have accommodations with disability services, but only for add ¡ª all I have is extended test time in a private test setting...but even this reminds me somewhat of solitary confinement.

ptsd,Kpopkinz,2020/3/21,"Possibly will be getting a diagnosis of PTSD soon, this is my story (TW) Hi I¡¯m Hanna I¡¯m 17, i grew up in a extremely toxic environment before my parents got divorced at the age of 13.
My parents would constantly scream at each other even sometimes breaking glass and when i was younger like 9 or 10 I thought it was completely normal, I remember going to friends houses and being confused why there house was so incredibly quiet. I remember vaguely one time when i raised my hand in elementary school and was like ¡°my daddy cusses alot¡± or something like that and i thought it was funny as i was only in 2nd grade or something. I feel like I completely blocked out my childhood which my therapist said is a sign of ptsd along with other symptoms i will describe later. As i was saying i blocked out alot of my childhood, i remember when i first started going to therapy when i was 13ish they would ask why i thought my childhood was toxic and what happened and I couldn¡¯t ever describe it in detail, this has happened multiple times between switching psychs and therapists and what i think is one of the main reasons a possible diagnosis was delayed for so long. I also have gotten panic attacks since around the same age (13) and currently have a diagnosis of panic disorder which i think will eventually be changed to ptsd. One of the main things that have effected me due to this was my horrible fear of any type of confrontation no matter how big or small even if it doesn¡¯t involve me, like for example say two people i know get into a small fight and you can feel the tension that could possibly cause me to cry or even have a panic attack. Or if it¡¯s a example that directly effects me like someone raising their voice at me, i will always cry without a doubt which has completely disrupted me having a job. This has also caused me to not be able to defend myself at all and i tend to get walked over ALOT and causes me to get in tons of toxic relationships amongst friendships and relationships. I was also sexually assaulted at 16 by a crush at the time and I don¡¯t feel comfortable going into detail with this part but with the toxic childhood I completely blocked it out so I don¡¯t get flashbacks with that trauma. But i know for sure i get flashbacks from the sexual assault I experienced as well as my mom often shaming me for the clothes i wear.

I started yoga at his recommendation (with some scepticism) and have had some really profound results regarding my mental health.

This prompted me to do further research and I came across this interview with Bessel Van Der Kolk who covers the subject of how trauma is being treated through teaching people to reconnect with their bodies:

ptsd,19yroldnarc,2020/2/6,"Disassociation During Sex? Hello there all,

I have an inquiry. My ex gf has a history of mental health issues including bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder traits (diagnosed by a professional). When she was 15, she was in a car with an older man who raped her at knifepoint. She reported the event and testified against him in court, leading to his conviction. Prior to the event, she had no experience with penetration or consensual sex. 

Now for my question. She confided in me with her history and mental health issues, and said that she feared sex due to her previously mentioned occurrence. I told her that a reaction of that sort is understandable, and that she should feel no pressure to be intimate in such a way until she feels ready. She told me she was ready and that she would like to have sex. During sex, I told her that I would go slow and even offered to let her take control and be on top. We started and while we were having intercourse things were okay for a minute until I felt her body tense and freeze. Her body began to spasm/shake and her nails dig into my back. She had an empty stare and appeared to have dissociated. I immediately stopped and freed myself from her grip. She was breathing heavy and appeared to be crying/angry yet wasn¡¯t responsive to any words or gestures. When I attempted to lay next to her and comfort her, she appeared aggressive and defensive (not sure which but she didn¡¯t want anything near her). After a few minutes, she snapped back into the situation and began to cry and apologize¡ªyet told me she wasn¡¯t aware of her clawing my back or of any of her actions. 

She told me she had a flashback to the event and could see the person and the knife, and that she felt completely gone from the moment.

The symptoms I have from this is increased anxiety when dating, fainting around people in certain social situations, and nightmares with thoughts that come up here and there about the event. What happened is I asked out this girl and she rejected me. But the real trouble started when I tried talking to her. She basically bullied me and I fainted right in front of her beside her friend. I feel so fucking embarrassed from that day on because I had to see her face over and over for the next two years reminding me of that event before she graduated from high school AND she babied me like I was fucking stupid. It was insanely awkward at one of my schools ceremonies because she ran the whole thing and I was called up and I had the worst anxiety I¡¯ve ever felt.

You think it's so under control and doesnt matter anymore and haven't had an episode in a long time but it's always there lurking under the surface ready to strike...how can something that happened over a decade ago have shattered my psyche so much that people, places, events and memories are just left as horrible triggers that I attempt to keep buried. 

Years ago I would never admit to mental health issues such as ptsd, anxiety and depression...it was also treated so much differently and you were just drugged into oblivion and kept it under the rug. The anxiety, agitation and depression like to rear their ugly head sometimes and it's just too hard to fight back so you fall into a pit of despair that takes awhile to get out of, but at least I get out and for that I'm a little stronger than I was.

He told me all my friends hated me when I was depressed, encouraged me to stop taking medication and fully supported unchecked manic episodes because he knew I could be easily persuaded into things I usually wouldn't with him. Long story short in a manic episode I tried convincing him that I was ""boring"" and ""depressing"" like how I was depressed and that I could fulfill his typical dude fantasy of having a threesome. After months of being pestered and berated I finally lost it when I was manic and set up to go to a sex party in a city so we could finally have a threesome. Once I walked into this party that I paid a few hundred for I told him explicitly once we entered the party that this was not a good idea and I was only open to talking to people and I didn't want to do anything at all. When I'm manic I'm scared of nothing, especially when I'm with my boyfriend and I feel like I'm just at a party. I ended up drinking too much and he let me get gang-raped by multiple old men and initiated it each time it happened. 

This happened very close to the anniversary of a previous time a boyfriend drugged me and raped me with his friend, it all seems so thematic and I don't know how to cope. Nothing feels completely real like I'm distanced from it. While I was with him I would first have repetitive dreams of him cheating on me (this was not paranoia because he had dating apps the entire time I later discovered), but then for a month straight after the last time we broke up, I would have repetitive dreams of him stabbing me in the stomach over and over again. But ever since the assault happened now I have these repetitive ""daydreams"" I guess of me freaking out and screaming, of slashing my throat or meeting him at a bar and stabbing him in the stomach instead. I've had rage attacks where I destroyed my apartment after he messaged me telling me I was a ""retarded bitch"" that deserved everything and that I should be lucky it went so well for me because he didn't get any other action. I have repetitive dreams of my childhood bedroom dark and murky and I can just hear myself screaming bloody murder in the background. The whole room is vibrating with the feeling of intense fear and anger in a way that honestly I've only felt in an LSD induced psychotic episode. I'm still in the throws of mania but I know that once the depression sets in the full weight will hit me and the full expression of PTSD symptoms will emerge, honestly I don't think they went away after the first time I was assaulted so if anything now they're just more magnified.

I have been on homicides and other disturbing calls.  In addition I have also been involved in a ""suicide by cop"" scenario that lasted for hours, and where mutliple times I sincerely thought the person we were trying to help was going to put a rifle round through me.  I did not end up being the one who shot, but saw it all happen.

It seems when I experience these  kinds of calls it opens a large wound.  Somethings concern or scare me.  For instance, there was once where I was with my wife and children on an outing and everything in my body started acting like an active shooter was about to engage.  I couldnt co yrol my breathing, heart rate, etc.  I have had dreams, though not consistent, of being shot and in fights for my life.  I have bouts where the images and memories intrude and I can't stop them, which is what happened today and has caused me to question my mental health a little.  Each time I get a little more worried.

I know it's not normal to spend hours around someone that just committed suicide in such a horrible way or experience what I deal with in my job on a regular basis.

My PTSD has romantic triggers and the worst of my trauma occurred once I moved in with my former partner. I've had to move in with my current partner due to COVID-19 to a rural place due to my immunodeficiencies. 

&amp;#x200B;

A strange feature of my PTSD is that I never really feel afraid of death, so that at least hasn't been consciously on my mind lately. However, I feel a strong amount of discomfort living with my partner, going through the motions of domesticity with another person present, and feeling controlled in my movements and my actions by his commentary. This is for the most part in my head, as the most he does is tut passive aggressively, but disapproval always puts me on high alert as I wonder what will happen next. I really don't like relationships in general, but I love him so I do try very hard to just maintain the status quo.

It's rough because we had a minor disagreement last night, it lingered over night (he refused to talk to me, which is petty but whatever, that's fine) and then we resolved it this morning. The day moved on - him to working from home, me to studying from home, and I decided to put on a podcast for lunch - suddenly, midway through it, I was heaving, terrified, I couldn't focus my eyes. For a second I was bewildered as it hadn't really occurred to me that I would or could have a flashback due to something so petty - and then I realised I *was*, and I felt like all the calm I've been trying to cultivate over the past few weeks spectacularly collapsed. I hate the feeling of having a flashback, I hate how hopeless it reminds me I am.

It makes me want to blow my fucking brains out for more reasons than one. (Don't worry, I'm legally obligated to say that I'm not suicidal at the moment.)

My abusive piece of shit mother (may she rest in piss) loved to dehumanize me for a number of factors ranging from my being bisexual to something as petty as my taste in music, but in particular she reveled in abusing me for my weight.

No one educated me on it back then. I'm getting an assessment soon so I can get an accurate diagnosis. Then therapy will continue after that.

I have gone through a ton of sexual abuse in my life. I don't want to get into detail because it's a very long history. But let's just say it started as a child and continued well into my 20s.

For the past year, anxiety attacks have been getting more and more frequent during sex. These attacks can present in a few different ways. Tonight, I felt sudden panic, started thrashing around uncontrollably, voiced that we needed to stop, and then curled up into a catatonic ball for 30 mins while unable to talk. I also completely forgot why I had started to panic and I've never had that happen before. Thankfully I've been with my fiance for a while now and he's really respectful and helpful in these situations.

Other attacks can present as suddenly bursting into tears, or just going straight into catatonic mode where I can't move, can't talk, stare off without blinking, and tense up my whole body. These are my most common attacks (they happen all the time outside of sex, but mostly in public or while driving) and I've had some last up to several hours. I've been getting pretty good at snapping our of it about 10 to 20 minutes in, though.

My question is, do you experience anxiety attacks or anything similar during sex, and do you have any tips for helping your sex life? I'm worried since it's become more frequent that it's going to become a serious issue. I am definitely looking forward to figuring this out in therapy, but in the meantime I was curious if anyone had any experience with this."

ptsd,_hello_everyone_,2020/1/30,"Please help me understand my friend's situation Trigger warning: rape, sexual abuse

My friend was raped when she was 11 years old, a fact she was never able to properly address or get treated for. A couple of years later, she started to experience sexual abuse from her father, beginning from touching to full-on rape almost every night while she was alone with him. This led to a first pregnancy at the age of 13, which she received an abortion for. I was there for her for all these nights although we are across the world from each other so there was very little else I could do. But she told me the details of what she went through every night, each night was a different experience with different details. It lasted for almost two years.

**Fast forward a couple more years, and she tells me that the sexual abuse she had received from her father wasn't real.** She says it is because of being raped at the age of 11 and never dealing with it, while at the same time having a tense relationship with her father. Somehow this manifested itself into false experiences that were so incredibly detailed for years.

I'm having a hard time accepting that it wasn't real because although it wasn't happening to me, I talked with her every night about what had happened. It was real for me. There are so many details or things that I need to have explained before I can fully understand what happened.

Unfortunately, after telling me that it wasn't real, my friend lost the ability to communicate at all. We haven't spoken in over a year, let alone spoken about the past. I'm scared I won't be able to talk it through with her and never know what was real or not, something that leaves me questioning all aspects of the past experiences we had.

I know it's a long-shot but if anyone can help me understand what may have happened and if it's realistic that she unintentionally had false experiences as a result of her rape.

One thing I struggle with though is my anger. I have a follow up appointment with a therapist on March 3rd, which is 3 months after I was discharged as I no longer am any risk to myself (yay!) so I¡¯ll talk to him about it, but I just wanted to post about it here.

Sometimes I just think about my situation, I had a good few male friends who decided to side with my friend who assaulted me, which is a pattern of how all of them have treated women. I didn¡¯t realise how they treated the females in their lives until I put all of these events together and realised. They aren¡¯t nice people, and sometimes that just makes me so angry because they¡¯re all just going to live their lives genuinely convinced that turning against a victim of sexual assault and covering it up was something that was justified because of their own personal issues. It makes me angry to the point of tears and I just want to be able to keep it under control, but im not sure how.

I¡¯ve been told this anger is normal, but I haven¡¯t ever had to deal with it because before this i was super non confrontational and calm so it¡¯d be nice to hear some tips, if anyone has any."

ptsd,Otakuosu,2020/4/8,"I have been diagnosed with PTSD because I was smoking weed. Since I have been diagnosed now for a while, I thought it would be interesting to share my story on this sub, since I haven't seen any, whose PTSD has developed solely by taking drugs:

Last year in November I went to a party on which I obviously smoked weed. My experiences with the drug were not always that nice, most of the time I would feel nothing but I was always relatively eager to try again, since my buddies were always so funny and happy after consumption.Well, I took a few puffs but there was one guy that encouraged me to just do more. High af I didn't care what would really happen so yeah... I had the worst experience in my life.From very strong hallucinations that involved my sense of touch, hearing and seeing to almost losing consciousness there was basically everything. I started sweating and freezing in a matter of seconds and my heart was jumping out of my chest. I was literally afraid to die due to a failure in my cardiac system. I told my friends to call the ambulance and after that night nothing was the same again.In the first months I had severe sleep disorders where I would constantly be reminded of my sense of balance. I would feel as if I was on that party not being able get a grip over my body.

Adding the aftermath of police drama and my mother trying to sue my friend for bringing the weed to the party, my mental health hasn't been in the best shape. I would consistently get panic attacks and in february I finally went to therapy. Being there has helped me immensely since I just didn't know what the hell was going on with me. Me and my therapist go along really well. We are doing a so called ""EMDRIA therapy"" (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) which has helped really well with processing what has happened on that day.

Unfortunately my past couple of weeks had been quiet rough. I was constantly overthinking basically everything. My relationship, my school, even my life. After talking with my therapist, this is still more likely connected to my PTSD and could be a adaptive depression following the latest events.

Almost two weeks ago I have gotten a tip from my therapist to try and and train thinking about logical things whilst noticing an upcoming panic attack. It basically moves your mind away from your body and focuses on the outside instead of the inside. Since then I was able to keep my panic attacks to a bare minimum. It feels great to be able to have a clear mind after some time again.Even with corona going on I have been able to keep my mind under control but as I am writing this I still feel some anxiety getting up. It just doesn't go away magically!

I would be really interested if there were similar cases!

(Side note: after talking to my regular doctor, she suggested that my cannabinoid system is just not really able to handle the consumption of weed. The hallucinations and everything I explained made the doctors in the hospital even skeptical and they didn't believe me I had only been smoking weed. They suggested LSD or a weird mixture of drugs I smoked but all they could find was THC.)"
ptsd,JillofManyTrades,2020/3/28,"Does anyone else? Stress is a trigger and apparently my coping mechanism would be to imagine a complete different scenario happening and me in real life playing along.

(I've worked through trauma that happened in my adult life, and shitty events from my childhood, but for many reasons I'm pretty sure there are events that I don't remember.) Last night I watched a good movie with my partner, scrolled on my phone (a mistake) after she went to bed, and then as soon as I tried to get into bed, I felt like I couldn't breathe and my heart started racing. I felt like I was back in my childhood bedroom and felt like I was going to throw up. I tried a sleepy meditation from insight timer, which is normally quite effective, but it couldn't overpower my racing thoughts and fears. I kept wondering ""what happened?!!!"" Finally I moved to a different room, read myself a book, cuddled with my dog... And still every time I felt sleepy and closed my eyes my heart rate shot up and I couldn't breathe. Anyway, I feel like crap this morning. I think I'm going to go back to taking melatonin and having a nice pre-bedtime routine with no phone.

I have an inkling of control of this situation compared to my other trauma, even though in reality I know I don't really over this virus and society.

ptsd,Boobachoob,2020/4/12,"Does anyone else press their head against the wall when anxious or stressed?

I realise cats and dogs aren't physiologically anything like people, but I press my head firmly into the wall when I get anxious or stressed, or sometimes when I have a headache or I'm just bored. With lockdown in effect I've been doing it super regularly now to combat my trigger of feeling trapped. It sounds so silly, but the pressure helps me and it's like it's instant relief of whatever negative thing I'm feeling. Sometimes if I stop doing it too soon, I feel worse, but if I keep doing it until I feel okay, it's like I feel almost euphoric afterwards. I think it releases endorphins.

Obviously I'm concerned that this might be a sign of brain trauma because the cause of my PTSD is from a physically traumatic event. I actually found out in February through my orthodontist (so through x-rays) that what happened to me fractured my jaw and I was walking around for years without knowing and it simply healed on its own. So, certainly substantial impact.

edit: whoops sorry, didn't want to solicit medical advice. I'll rephrase.

I plan to call a doctor in the morning just to be safe.

Does anyone else do this, out of curiosity?"
ptsd,arga1234,2020/2/25,"Several months ago I was assaulted and knocked unconscious. Two times in the past week after smoking marijuana (new user), I have ""blacked out"" and woken up minutes later not remembering anything about myself, specifically since the assault. Was I just too high or is there a bigger problem here? I will try to keep this succinct, but there is a lot of context. First I should preemptively clarify that I have no memory at all of being randomly assaulted in the bar. Thankfully the assaulter was caught and is facing charges. I am new to smoking weed as of a couple months ago (this is after the assault). I have gotten high with no abnormal experiences maybe 10 times before these two instances. I am a male in his mid twenties who is in a high level graduate school (so there are other stressors in addition to the assault). I also sustained a broken bone on my jaw that needed surgery to fix. I now have a scar under my jaw/top of my neck that is not at all visible from a front view but  is noticeable from some angles on my side. 

When I ""woke up"" from blacking out for the first time while I was high,  I was alone in my apartment. The best depiction is it felt like I relived the experience of waking up in the ER  after the assault with no memories or understanding of why I was there. Sitting in my apartment, I suddenly started regaining the memories of who I am and what has happened in my life. For example, one moment I thought to myself ""do I have a scar on my jawline?"" and I touch my jawline and I realize I do and more pieces of the puzzle start filling in over the next minute or two. I'm hit with a ton of sadness from all these sudden realizations while simultaneously freaking out that I'm seemingly having a severe lifelong case of amnesia. 

My initial rationalization after all the pieces of the puzzle filled in is that I'm depressed and that has caused me to live in a haze as if im in autopilot the past several months. Ive never had depression in the past and I'm not even sure what it would feel like, but in that moment I told myself (Im still high by the way) this must be what depression feels like. The next day I saw the school counselor/therapist and told her what I had experienced (she was aware of the assault and I had seen her three prior times in the past several months). I did slightly lie, telling her that I was drunk instead of high. She talked me through it and said she was not ready to try to give me some specific disorder but if she had to she might use the term ""adjustment disorder"". 

Fast forward to a week later and it happens to me again, this time its when Im high with some of my classmates (my classmates know what happened to me and are obviously very supportive). It feels like my sober brain is trying to shield me/protect me from the pain of what happened to me by making me live in a haze, as if nothing happened to me. And then when I'm high the veil over that facade gets lifted. Ive never had an symptoms of amnesia when I'm not high. So is this all explained by me just being too high or do you think there might be a larger clinical and psychological/mental health issue that I'm facing?"
ptsd,kansasrules,2020/2/17,"The moment that changed me and my thought process for the rest of my life Stay in my room until work, either sleeping the whole time or manic af from lack of sleep and minimal drug use. Not good i know but i have to start being honest at least w myself. 
I found this year that i enjoy dulling down my reality instead of facing problems. 

?Drugs make me feel something, while dulling down the pain
I don't want to escape as much as i want to numb my thoughts from hurting myself. When my thoughts become verbal my moods lash out on others and it makes me hate my existence that much more. 
Which triggers a wave of suicidal thoughts, self doubt, and a can't do attitude. 
I just give up
I am sick and tired of holding the weight of these ideations within the thin barriers of my skull, im growing old and tierd.
When it started, i thought i brought these thoughts into my head, and i would feel shame for it. For why am i doing this to myself?
6 years later its gotten progressively worse, i quit drinking and began a regaulr pill regimen? (also smoking marajuana) to keep myself balanced, or calm. I was less on edge, found a bit of happiness within myself and my creative side and began to feel human again. 
Now the flip side to that is the rap sheet of side effects that come along with these pills.
Stabalize your mind, sacrifice your body.
It's taking a chance everytime, adverse reactions and misdiagnosis over those 6 years didn't help. By the timei was aged 25 i had been on or around 25 different pills and different combinations within of those pills. 
By the end of my 6 years medication tweaking process, and 3 misdiagnosis, 6 hospitalizations, and pretty much a team of specialists, and a dozen doctors,? along w a cat scan of my brain in 2014.
It took hell of a toll on my body, and brain functions. My liver an kidneys wont last forever..
The runaround, a serious uphill battle im still pushing through..learning a lot about my mind and mostly thought process.
Why am i so mean to myself? 

?and as of today my diagnosis is schizoaffective disorder bi polar type, i struggle with anxiety (mostly social) and frequent panic attacks (which can be triggered by the way someone i know looks me wrong) me being called sensitive would be a huge understatement. Around the time of my first hospitalization in 2009 i witnessed my friend and roommate at the time get beat within an inch from his life with brass knuckles to the face. 
I remember nothing past the porch where he laid still, getting beat on our own front lawn repeatedly. 
My mind permanently blocked that from me.Next time i have a memory from that moment im looking over him-- laying in the blood soaked grass, in total shock. His face was a blood puddle, in panic mode i went and scooped him from his back to his feet. At that second i embraced his tall frail figure as his wounds dripped down onto my suicidal tendencies shirt (oh the irony)? my arms wrapped all the way around his body, for i just wanted him to feel safty or comfort. Grabbing him by the hand i guidedus to a safer space indoors.
Around me was a blur, friends and neighbors scolded me, for ""he could have a neck or back injury! Leave him laying!"" 
I was not only in shock, but also processing a violent and traumatic event that changed my life forever. 
I was scared, he was petrified. 
I told all the neighbors and by standers basically to fuck off and
As for my friend- now gushing blood from his cuts, eye sockets, mouth and nose. 
just like a skipping cd in your old walkman, he was stuck in a constant shuddering loop fearing for his life. 
""They're going to come back and kill me""
Over and over and over and over..
Once into our house i lead him into the bathroom, swiftly locking the door behind.
""Call 911, they're going to come back and kill me"" again and again as he ran water over his face, pressing his broken bone structure completely flat, blood pouring from all parts of his kind and beautiful face. 
He couldn't feel it, he could barely process what had happened, for it happened so fast. 
I watched him try to
Rinse all the blood away only more would streamout.&amp;Panic struck, the ambulance was now on its way but inwas starting to expierence by first delusion. 
After that summer i didn't see my friend again until 10 years later. 
What i said to him was, i have been through so much since then that stemmed from that dark moment in our past, struggled with literal demons inside my head, woken up to images of corpses laying in my bed. 
But i will never know how you managed to stay so strong, so beautiful, and so kind even after something so awful could happen. 
I have no idea how he did it i said, how he pulled through and came out on top.
Dude, he could have been beat to death if someone hadn't stepped in. 

One of the moments that shaped me, made me grow and helped me learn so much about myself id never had gotten the chance to if our paths may not have crossed. 
Cos i usually think ""man, i wonder what life would've became if these blips in time hadn't happened at all?""
Maybe id have some sort of success, or maybe just no chronic disorder that effects almost every aspect of my life in some sort of way. Im unsure, always wonder, then feel weak minded.
Soon after we went through this i found myself laying on my bare bed, last nights last breath escapingaway as the mourning sun crept through the crack in the window where the card board had shifted.
I stayed home all alone with my thoughts that night. 
Not knowing how many sleepless nights, and waking nightmares mixed with violent hallucinations id have ahead of me. 
The mind is a very fragile thing, science knows little about mental illness as it is-so to see me, 4 or 5 days later after that night, days became weeks then into one bad blurred summer.
To explain it all in full detail wouldn't make any sense whatsoever -but i basically looked like your local circle k crack head on no sleep talking to the air. 
Sad thing is, mental illness and drug addiction look a whole lot alike. 
Your brain looses one to many days of sleep then all the sudden i think im related to? Egyptian gods, and my brother is a cannabal living on an ancient Indian burial ground, and theres a government drone disguised as a house fly watching me.
The house was alive, and teeth snapped my feet at every step.
The windows were breathing. I sawa glimpse of a body on the stain in the laundry room, had conversations with hairless rats and sat in a chair crafted from hitlers bones.
I could feel the chill air pass, i felt negative spirits, saw shadow people while christmas carolers sang outside my door.
None of this was real, this was just a snipit of the things i've seen and heard but told they weren't really there. 
I was awake, yet dreaming in gruesome splashes and disorganized thoughts. 
I was alive to exist. 
I felt pain all over.
Once admited i was so unrulyi wasn't able to be near any other patients at least half a day to a day. I spent that time in the yellow hallway in the nude and a pair of flats, pissing on myself while flooding my room. 
When they brought my food, i ripped my name badge from the tray. I ate my name for dinner, refused the meal, kicking it across the hallway.
Water began to trickle out of my room, and by the time they asked me to get dressed they saw..
I shoved all the sheets, blankets and my clothes into the toilet, and sink only to keep them running and flushing til someone decided to check on my crazy naked ass.
I just didnt want to be alone.
So i made sure they had to keep me close, and segregating an unstable lil girl who wants to die and has no clue what reality is anymore is inhumane. 
I spent the next 3 weeks there making no damn sence, i was completely detached from reality coloring with crayons, banging my head inbetween the door way and the wall. 
It hurt everywhere in a different way, but they couldnt make it stop so i would hurt myself. 
I hadn't showered in over a week, 2 nurses insisted on helping me bathe. 
Once in the water all i could do was scream, cry and fight them.
I was 20.
Life hit different for me young, and life got in the way of a lot of things but it humbled m

ptsd,NovaLaurant,2020/3/19,"Advice for coping with a house full of screams Hi, Lurker of the sub here (24/F, Chilean) 

I... Didn't know where to go to get help. I doubt I could get a therapist for this in particular given the hysteria and fear in the streets. Sorry if grammar is not adequate. 

I'm really sensitive to screams. I have ptsd and right know I'm trapped with my mother, my grandmother, a cousin and my uncle in this house. The issue here is the latter: everything that displeases him (that is everything woman-related or every little thing) sends him into a flying rage that has him screaming at the top of his lungs, berating the TV, my grandma (who is the same as him and NOT an innocent, sweet old lady) or whatever is the object of his wrath. He throws things, says everything in the spectrum of my triggers and if you try to tell him to stop he berates even harder, accusing you of being ""weak, soft, and someone who will die in a merciless world like a worm"". 

At this point I have no doubt he's schizo-typical in terms of personality, as he has all the traits and has to convince everyone about conspiracies, aliens and the New World Order, everyone has to conduct themselves according to his believes in order to not get your face screamed off. He normalises violence, and though he never has lifted a hand against us, it's threatening nonetheless. 

I can't deal with that level of screaming every hour, I'm not exaggerating. He in the past has humiliated me, has attacked me emotionally, shamed me for using medication, for defending my mother, me and afterwards said ""he did it because he loved me"" (I have ptsd because of my dad and just the same trigger phrase). 

I just want to cry, I don't have a place to run given that where I live the pandemia is being controlled with military force. I'm also part of the target group because of asthma and other lung related issues. How do you deal with this? How have you dealt with the situation? He screams so loud that I can hear him perfectly on my room... Please help...

I have posted this in other sub, sorry for doing it, I just need urgent advice and honestly I'm such a trainwreck right now that I don't know if I'm doing things right without feeling a lot of anxiety."
ptsd,robotbotany,2020/1/26,"Emotional hangover Does anyone else get these after opening up to a new person? 

I spent the evening with a new friend and our conversations got pretty deep, and I ended up opening up about my ptsd and my traumas. It was well received and everything went fine. The next morning I woke up feeling terribly insecure and overwhelmed with anxiety. 

I am generally pretty open about my PTSD but usually don't go into details unless someone asks and I trust them. Even so, I always feel so stupid and vulnerable the next day. It's completely exhausting and triggers symptoms. However, I feel like the more often I open up about it the easier it gets. 

I've struggled with PTSD for about seven years and some times in my life are much easier than others. But whenever I wake up feeling shameful for being honest and having to remember everything I've been through, I am reminded that this disorder will exist in me indefinitely."

ptsd,houseontherock,2020/3/12,"Stop being scared? I have ptsd from an accident and I get triggered from hearing about tragedy and danger or feeling people around me are doing dangerous stuff but sometimes I feel triggered from other stuff like just feeling like things are off or even having memories of childhood abuse brought up or the season changing or just other things that make me question my self. During around this time last year I was having issues with flashbacks and I think those feelings are coming back up and I feel frustrated and powerless trying to fight these feelings of fear that are making it hard for me to work, eat and generally live. I feel trouble breathing and I feel especially scared in the morning or when I wake up. When I don't smoke I have bad nightmares. I try to feel better by going outside places even if it reminds me of bad memories or its scary, or watching South Park or reality TV, listening to music, smoking and reading scary stories to distract myself.

I was talking with my friend asking what they would do if they felt scared and they were talking about trying to remove the danger from the situation, lock doors etc. It's hard for me to describe the feeling but someone described it once like being on an airplane going down for hours. I feel very scared as if each moment time passes is screaming through my ears because something horrible dangerous and violent is about to happen in my immediate world and people around me. It can just help to talk to friends and make sure they're still alive and not as scared as me about something happening today or tomorrow and know they don't feel this way even if that means they don't understand.

ptsd,Maggots_and_Vanilla,2020/3/14,"Wanting to meet an old friend Before I continue let me give some needed context. At the ages of ten to eleven I was molested by my best friend's grandfather. She was my very first true friend and sadly lost after I exposed what he was doing to me to my parents. Once charges were brought and he last an agonizing two weeks in jail his family, along with my dear friend, hated my guts and sided with him despite the evidence. 
Ever since then I've always wanted to reunite with her. I feel as if our friendship was cut off unfairly and keep finding myself pondering ways to somehow contact her once more. This feeling grew even more once I made a realization with my therapist he was more likely molesting her and was trying to replace her once I came into the picture. 
Should I try to find her or should I just let her fade away from my life seeing how much the event effected her? Am I just grabbing at straws to see if I can fix an already broken childhood by pursuing this search? More importantly, can anybody relate to this feeling?

I'm 18 and have been stuck with her due to the corona virus and she just Burst into my room at 2-3 AM to yell at me about school that I have apparently not done. She then got my stepdad involved, and then she started accusing him of stuff too, all of which are completely rediculous.

It's an offense to even suggest you may need help, to suggest that anyone should even consider helping you. Because in their eyes, you must have done something to ""deserve"" poverty, or homeless. It's like a moral branding to them. It doesn't matter how you became severely poor/homeless, and it doesnt matter how desperately you're fighting to survive/escape your circumstances. ""Poor/homeless"" is all they need to know to ""know"" that you're unworthy of help, or of compassion. You're the scum beneath their feet. You're not even human.

Even after being homeless and tormented for a year, and then in poverty for 4, I still feel myself become crushed under the weight of people's disgust for poor/homeless people. It utterly shocks me. It steals the breath from my lungs. 

The internet is full of cruelty and anger, obviously, but..... it's not just on the internet, anyways, not by a longshot. People are not shy about their disgust for poor people, and if you haven't been in extreme poverty you may not have even noticed how bad it is. You may have some deeply rooted hatred and judgement inside you, too. 

It's. horrifying. And it brings me back to the most horrifying days/experiences of my life. I think i had a conclusion to this, but i feel like a child again, starving and absolitely terrified and being proven to that even the mostly seemly compassionate or kind people will turn on you the moment you have no money. The moment you become """"worthless"""". 

Here's a conclusion i guess,,, Anyone else traumatized by poverty/homelessness, or more specifically, how people treated you because you were in poverty/homeless"
ptsd,fishonthesun,2020/3/18,"Quarantined in the house trauma occurred in Without going into detail, I have no choice but to stay in the house in which traumatic things occurred. Not at the hands of the people staying here, so anyone concerned about that, don't worry. 

But still, I'm having ""minor"" flashbacks a couple times a day and intrusive thoughts and memories all the time. The nightmares are worse too. It sucks sleeping in the bed a trauma occurred in. 

My therapist is too far away to get to, as well as elderly, so I can't risk that due to the people constantly in and out of my house I may be a carrier and infect her.

Anyways, I was hoping someone who has progressed further in therapy than I to give some tips on how to cope? I could google but I figured people who have experience with my specific situation would have better tips, or things a professional or person onliene may not have considered as helpful.

Thanks so much."
ptsd,LightSquirrel,2020/3/17,"Recently Diagnosed So yesterday I had my mental health feedback with the psychologist at my city¡¯s youth wellness centre and I got diagnosed with two mental health disorders.

The first one which I was expecting (due to my background in psych) was Illness Anxiety Disorder which is what I¡¯ve been diagnosed with. It means that I tend to think of the worse when it comes to any little physical symptom I have and it can panic attacks. 

Now this is where I was surprised with the second diagnosis. I was diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder which I did not expect at all. I was in literal shock and felt like, ¡°wait, but I only had one traumatic experience in my life, how can I have PTSD¡± and I didn¡¯t realize that all my intrusive memories, avoidance of areas, social events and certain types of people, hell my negative changes in my mood, behaviour and way of thinking is because of this.

Now, I¡¯m not going to list my trauma because it¡¯s NSFW, and I merely just wanna talk about my reaction to my diagnosis because I¡¯m still in shock and processing it.

But I honestly thought I was depressed. Not traumatized. I honestly kept minimizing my pain because I believed that people have gone through worse things than me but for something that I have gone through to affect my behaviour and cognition to the point it affects my daily routine is still shocking.

I don¡¯t know how to feel about this to be honest. I didn¡¯t even expect this."

ptsd,owufcjneldshwn,2020/2/1,"I¡¯m missing a gap in my childhood. Hey, everyone.
A bit of background; I grew up in an emotionally and somewhat physically abusive household. My mother is psychotic, and didn¡¯t take her medication. She¡¯d have frequent episodes of squeezing ¡°worms¡± out of her face and being entirely delusional and out of touch with reality most of the time. My eldest brother was physically abusive toward my mother and sister, and my mother would purposely put me in harms way in hopes of shielding herself from my brother. Police were involved. I witnessed countless traumatic things as a young child, most of which I didn¡¯t remember until recently when I started seeing a therapist, who asked about these kind of things. It all started at 4 years old and 12 years later, it¡¯s still happening. It happens less frequently and (usually) not as severe. So, to the part about me forgetting a chunk of my childhood: My brother and I were talking the other night and a few traumatic memories came up. We also realised that (we think, roughly) 1 year and a half - 2 years of our lives are just gone. Blank. We¡¯re pretty sure this has something to do with witnessing even more terrible things that our brains must¡¯ve shut out. (Also to add in, this isn¡¯t the abusive brother, this is my other older brother) my therapist said she thinks I may have PSTD and that she¡¯ll look into it with me. I¡¯m not necessarily saying that I have PTSD, I¡¯m not really one to self diagnose. Though, is this common? I¡¯ve been having flashbacks the past few years the more I¡¯ve started to remember and think about my childhood, usually waking up from them in the middle of the night. But I didn¡¯t even realise that I had a whole chunk of my life missing until a day or two ago. Any comments are really appreciated, and thank you for taking the time to read this."

ptsd,CluelessConception,2020/3/31,"Do I have sexual trauma?  Ok so am 17F and I have experienced a lot of trauma that I am already struggling to accept and cope with in the first place, but to top this off I feel like I don¡¯t know if I really do have, or have a right to have even, sexual trauma.
	I guess I should start by saying that I never really questioned wether I had experienced sexual abuse until I was about 12. I had been at a sleepover with a group of friends when one of us had told them about a certain person in their life that they didn¡¯t trust and disliked because they had sexual abused her. She was wanting to get what had happened off of her chest and felt that she was in a safe place to talk about what had happened and so she told us (me and our friends). When this happened it sort of spurred us all to talk about any similar situation we¡¯d been in. Me trying to comfort her at the time told her that to an extent I had understood what she was going through because I had been sexually abused by a relative. Now, keep in mind my memory about this talk is very spotty on its own as I have memory issues but, up until that point that I told her this I figured I¡¯d never been sexually abused. Even as I told her this I told myself, and felt like, it was  a lie that I¡¯d made up for attention or to seem relatable (yea fucked up I know). 
	But after telling her this I started having lots of what seemed to be memories of sexual abuse that I to this day don¡¯t know if they are true. But they come and go like some other ptsd flashback and memories I have. So at this point I¡¯m questioning if maybe I had experience previous sexual trauma and that conversation had triggered the memories to be there. Whenever these memories or flashbacks come I brush it off as something I created in my head but now that I am going to therapy my therapist is telling me that what I¡¯m experiencing is ptsd and that like many people with ptsd, my mind is telling me that it is all made up, because that would be easier to deal with than the reality of trauma. 
	I¡¯m also real,y worried about this lately because my therapist has mentioned that we are going to start a kind of ptsd segment in therapy so that I can basically come to terms with these things and move on. But this is very frightening for me because for one I sincerely believe it¡¯s a lie and secondly it makes me feel so ashamed and vulnerable and just stupid and stressed to talk about. Yesterday during an on,one therapy session she gave me a list of emotions and asked me to tell her about any events in my life where I felt these emotions and I felt that at some point she was expecting me to bring up said sexual abuse, so my mind kept traveling to that and I almost cried! Which doesn¡¯t make sense to me because how could I become so emotional and uncomfortable with something that I¡¯d made up on my own?! After that session I dissociated for hours  and I can¡¯t remember a large chunk of my day yesterday because of that. 
	I apologize for how long this is but basically I just want to know if this seems.....real? Is it possible that it¡¯s real or is it something I just made up? My therapist tells me that the majority of the ptsd that I am currently struggling with stems from this event but how could that be true if it wasn¡¯t real? Is she wrong?"
ptsd,Raccoon392,2020/3/19,"I need advince (TRIGGER WARNING) First off I'm not self-diagnosing I'm just trying to figure things out as much as I can without a therapist because if I go to one I could make everything worse, I think.

In 2018 the day before new year's eve my dad got drunk and sat on the sofa holding a fish knife threatening to either kill my mum or himself by saying 'you made me do this' I (14 at the time) was the only child to walk in on my mum yelling at him saying she was going to call the police, a few days later he sent us all messages making it sound like he was going to kill himself (he wouldn't.)  which he had done a few months ago, then I had responded with sympathy but after seeing what I saw his shitty messages that showed how bad our relationship was anyway I didn't give him anything he wanted and ignorenored me for 6 months straight, I let him back in because my mum had told me that he was really worried about getting me something for my birthday and I honestly thought he had changed, then I went on a trip to Belgium and they split again after a huge argument and everything went to shit again. Then we got our shit together and things got better and it was getting to Christmas and I had been exited but as it got closer all I could think about was what he did, it made my anxiety worse but it threw me into a spiral of hating myself and my family and everything around me and just wanting to lie in bed all day and think about killing myself. (Probably important to say I link what he did to Christmas more than new years) I didn't want to do anything and I just felt shitty and tired and my family didn't help because they said I was being 'grumpy'.

Then recently my mum got a boyfriend and decided to tell my dad about it after telling me that if he found out it could mean that we'd be in danger and then all I could think about was him sending me messages like he was going to kill himself again and it just destroyed me and then I started spiralling again and now I can't look in the mirror without crying. 

I also nearly cried talking about a poem that was related to someone having a relationship with someone else because my dad was a controlling asshole but now I see him a few times a week and it's like he a different person to who did those shitty things.

Has anyone else experienced anything like this and douse this sound like minor PTSD or something? Any advice is welcome and if this is nothing like what PTSD is then ill leave because I honestly have no idea what it's like to have ptsd."

I was terrified and knew I was going to be killed when the staff of the hospital I was in forced their way into my room with guns, 5 of them restrained me (because I was fighting for my life) and laughed about how they were going to pour acid in my face before they shot me. I was there for an hour thinking about how I¡¯d never see my parents again, how I was going to die in pain etc. Now obviously I was not in real danger and I know the criteria for something like PTSD requires a threat to life. But I believed that threat as much as anyone in a real situation like that so I don¡¯t know if it counts? I get horrible panic attacks about it still, jump at loud noises (in case they¡¯re gunshots), palm escape routes in buildings, have nightmares and refuse to go near the town the hospital was based in. It¡¯s really impacting my life to this day. 

Anyway, about 8 years ago when I was in high school, a friend of mine was murdered in her home along with her family - stabbed to death. It was a horrible time obviously but didn¡¯t have a long term traumatic effect on me. However, since the psychosis incident, I can no longer handle anything involving knives or news reports about stabbing - they make me revisit that time and create scenarios about my friends death in my head.

Does new trauma sometimes make old trauma worse? I don¡¯t really understand a) why the first incident is still affecting me so badly and b) why I¡¯m suddenly impacted by my friend¡¯s death from so long ago?

I have no memories of ever having been anything other than a sad, sometimes angry child. She can be quite abusive emotionally so I'm not really sure what she wanted me to take away from that, it felt a little accusatory like she believes 5 year-old-me decided to become bitter just to flex on her.

It reminded me of when I was 13 and I went to a doctor for my insomnia. After talking with her and testing a few things she wanted to talk to my parents so they came with me to the next appointment. he told them that there seemed to be no physical problem but from our conversation she could tell that I probably needed therapy. My father basically told her that I was a dramatic idiot who made things up for attention and we left.

Now the trauma is resurfacing, new memories are coming and I can barely function. Not to mention the added trauma of having grown up without effective coping mechanisms and the abusive relationship I got into and stayed into because I didn't know I was a human being who deserved to be treated as such.

ptsd,odetothegalaxy,2020/2/25,"Everything triggers flashbacks, crying every day I¡¯m 23 years old, and last year in April my 15 year old brother hung himself in his closet. 
We were best friends, partners in crime. We told each other everything. The moment I learned of his passing was a completely life-altering moment for me and nothing has ever been the same since. 
I was in weekly therapy for 6 months after the loss. We were mostly trying to manage my grief and anxiety but my therapist would frequently grow frustrated with me because she didn¡¯t feel like I was getting better. 
I was having extremely frequent flashbacks the first 6 months, about 75-100 flashbacks a day where I would replay the moment I learned of my brothers passing obsessively in my head. At first I didn¡¯t realize they were flashbacks and would just tell her I could never stop thinking about that day and that they became intrusive thoughts. Eventually, a friend of mine I confused in told me what was going on sounded like PTSD, which was something she suffered from. 
I saw a psychiatrist and was immediately diagnosed with severe comorbid ptsd (I also have a panic disorder, and I¡¯m bipolar). Upon telling my therapist she discharged me as a client THAT DAY because PTSD did not fall under her specialties. 
I¡¯ve been too afraid to be vulnerable to another professional since, but since I have been going 4 months nearly 5 without therapy, my PTSD is starting to take over my life. 
My medication seemed to stop helping, and my flashbacks have become extremely frequent and are now being accompanied by nightmares. 
It¡¯s gotten to the point where words, colors, songs, and phrases trigger me into a flashback and typically when I am having these flashbacks I start to panic and uncontrollably cry. I can¡¯t handle my grief, I can¡¯t contain my pain, and it spills over the edge. It¡¯s absolutely horrible. 
I¡¯m a hairdresser and I¡¯ll have clients say certain words to me like ¡°hang¡± ¡°closet¡± ¡°died/death¡± ¡°brother¡± or make jokes about suicide even though it¡¯s completely out of context I¡¯ll have to excuse myself and try to get my episodes under control. It¡¯s happened with my coworkers, and I just started a new job so they don¡¯t even know about my brother, let alone by PTSD. 
I hear songs he liked on the radio in the grocery store and will literally be sobbing in the aisles. I can¡¯t tell you how frequently I see someone who looks so much like him it takes my breath away and I have to go weep in the bathroom. Let alone the fact that in my mind I see him hanging every time I open my closet. 
It is becoming extremely difficult to function when I can not control these flashbacks and my reactions to them, I¡¯m not ready to explain to the people around me what I¡¯m going through because it is so awkward having to deal with the sympathy. 
It¡¯s taking over my life and the anniversary is quickly approaching, I don¡¯t know how to be by myself and that makes it hard because I live alone. I battle my own suicidal ideation which has since worsened. I still have 50-100 flashbacks a day. Sometimes more. 

I can¡¯t take this anymore. I really need some advice on coping skills and how I can change this dreadful thought process I have. I wish my medications still worked for me because they were helping truthfully for a couple of months. I¡¯m genuinely afraid to go back to therapy since my last one dropped me so fast, and I always felt like she didn¡¯t like me.

ptsd,Alamoholo,2020/1/17,"Nightmares affecting sleep Posting for a friend. (I hope this is the right subreddit for this.) I'd like to understand a little better what she might be going through and any suggestions on things that might help her.

Brief background. She's an adult now, but was physically and sexually abused by multiple family members from roughly ages 4-9. She has almost nightly nightmares of the abuse. Previously they have been of the family member, but the past week it's been ""strangers"". 

Is there anything that someone would suggest that might help her get some sleep? She barely manages a few, unrestful hours.

As a note, I'm know that I'm not any sort of replacement for a professional, and she knows that I recommend she find one. Just looking for some insight, and possibly something that might help a little.

I served a deployment in Afghanistan, and I immediately went to my local mental health clinic when I noticed everything was different, and I was miserable and borderline suicidal. My therapist pretty much flat out told me the diagnosis, and gave me a talk about the different therapy options regarding PTSD. I am scared, and extremely sad.  I don't know where to begin with this, and I don't know where go from here.  What can I expect moving forward, and does this ever get better?"
ptsd,Cacarosa,2020/1/4,"Had a traumatic childhood and not sure if I have ptsd? As the title says, I had a very traumatic childhood due an abusive father that was alcoholic and every day my house would become a battlefield that I felt I had to survive to.
This happened almost daily until I was 16 that I left that house to never see him again.

I'm 26 now and I have very vivid images of the memories  I have from back then, even from when I was a little girl, I can remember it like a picture. I don't have flashbacks per se but I can get stuck remembering the same moment for a bit.

I also tend to have vivid dreams and sometimes have nightmares where my dad is the protagonist and wake up crying.

Any insight on it would help loads as I always tend to brush it off, my family and friends don't really understand it and it can be difficult to talk about it.

I do not want to be diagnosed but I've been dealing with it for so long that I downplay it constantly, just keen ears and opinions will be really appreciated."
ptsd,polyamorys,2020/2/9,"what are some strategies for controlling/calming a ptsd flashback? i¡¯ve noticed that when i am out somewhere with my partner and i get triggered (usually through seeing my abuser), i have very difficult episodes in which i no longer see my partner as ¡®safe¡¯ because he doesn¡¯t look like my partner, or ¡®feel¡¯ like my partner - instead he looks like/feels like my abuser. this can make things so hard though, because he¡¯ll try helping me but will inadvertently set me off, i¡¯ll try getting away from him, and that i¡¯m alone in a public, crowded space which obviously doesn¡¯t help my ptsd episode.

this is probably one of the biggest issues in our relationship, and it sucks, because neither of us want to end a relationship we are generally incredibly happy in because of external factors (ie. trauma and ptsd episodes from an abuser). we¡¯re trying to brainstorm some strategies that he or i could do in these scenarios to prevent me becoming scared of him, so that he can help me better and help us get out of the situation. however, i¡¯m a bit stuck on any ideas or strategies that we could use, especially when we are out in public and i see my abuser. i get really stuck in my head, and it can feel very difficult to trust him. i¡¯m a bit clueless when it comes to coping mechanisms. so i was reaching out to see if any of you have any strategies or mechanisms to calm a flashback, or strategies my partner can use to reassure me that he isn¡¯t my abuser/is safe/is just trying to help me.

ptsd,MyThrones,2020/3/19,"Diagnosed with PTSD for years. Was recently exposed to a coworker pleasuring himself during a conference call. (Trigger Warning: sex abuse, self harm) Apologies for the long read. Bit of a backstory of myself: I (male) was sexually abused as a child for many years by a much older man. From ages 2 or 3 all the way till 11. With depression, anxiety, add and ptsd all mixed in, I am rather broken. I give others an impression that I have everything together, but years and years of medication only makes me feel more alone and different than everyone else.

Without going into too much detail for job security purposes, I will be somewhat vague.

I work in sales where we have large participates in a video call where many may be at home using PC/phones to be on the call. Most opt to turn off their cameras and mics and only listen to the host explain company changes. If one decides to have their camera turned on, they must appear in company dress code attire. We are paid for these biweekly and sometimes monthly calls. So we are on company time.

While browsing through the long list of participates and viewing who has their video feed turned on, I noticed a man making fast hand movements with only wearing underwear. Clearly I knew what he was doing. So I took a screenshot to show to HR as evidence. Many times throughout the few minutes, I saw the man's penis in full plain view.

I don't know if he was masturbating to pictures of other video call participates or not. But after finally realizing his video was on, he turned it off and a minute later he left the call.

I contacted HR and provided all the evidence I have and opted to take a week off since I am so close to losing my mind from this experience that only reminded me of my hell.

I am taking unpaid time off and will be seeking psychiatric help in this time as I feel medication is once again needed so I can function at work like nothing happened once again. I currently don't have medical insurance through work nor any paid time off which is all the more depressing.

I am awaiting for HR to contact me to look at options or any guidance at all. But I feel so defeated and once again my depression is giving me suicidal thoughts."
ptsd,TheEverAurora,2020/1/3,"My memories aren't about my trauma? So I just discovered I have ptsd from severe illness (still isn't over). Just started seeing a specialised therapist.

My nightmares however are related to the trauma. For example I dream about choking or drowning everynight because I would throw up all day and involuntarily and consecutivly gag on an empty stomach, causing me to not be able to breathe for a while.

What does that mean? Did the illness trigger some other trauma?"

ptsd,ko1298,2020/2/10,"Struggling with Memory Loss I was recently diagnosed with PTSD due to an emotionally abusive childhood. I¡¯ve always had a terrible long term memory, and learning that this is because of trauma and PTSD has been hard to deal with. Does anyone have any advice on coming to terms with not being able to remember (good OR bad things)? Or any advice on being able to remember more?"
ptsd,bmorcrazy,2020/2/24,"(Trigger warning) the memory barrier I built of my childhood started collapsing last week after watching a movie. This is a bit of a rant and probably horribly structured 

I watched the movie honey boy and the similarities broke down the memory wall I built. My mental health had hit critical about two years ago, I was diagnosed with complex ptsd with suicidal ideation, which I had known for awhile it was most likely that. I started going to therapy, I quit drinking and doing drugs, started medication again, things have been getting better slowly. Now the wall is down, memories and emotions started flooding in, flashbacks started again, suicidal ideation started more frequently ( I will never go through with it) and for the life of me I can't seem to understand how bad my situation was growing up, I know it was wrong and not normal but something is blocking me from viewing it rationally. It was just my life, I have no other perspective or anything I can compare it to.  I'm more writing this out to just to get it out so... Here we go

My first memory of my father was when I was 2 to 4, my mom was leaving for work, he was hungover I'm assuming and I was crying staring out the window because she was leaving me, I didn't stop after she left, I remember my dad had his hand on his face not looking well, barley attempting to calm me down when he grabbed my pj shirt and slapped me across the face, the memory ends there. Typically he would use a belt or a metal shoe horn, he didn't get more physical until I was older but that is maybe my first memory of my childhood that comes to mind. Everything is fuzzy but that one is clear as day. I would run away from him when I would get in trouble and he would chase me around the house snapping his leather belt over and over until he caught me and would then beat me bare ass with it, I can't remember the pain or even being hit with the belt, I just remember the before it happened. I do remember I would become hysterical often but I can't clear up andly specific memories, I just feel the emotion and I know it happened often. 

The next portion of memories start when I thought my parents, mainly my dad, my mom was never abusive, would turn into wear wolves when I would turn my back, everytime I turned around I thought they were sneaking up on me claws over their heads about to eat me, I would often follow them around and try to catch them, I had a fear of being alone because I always thought they were going to get me if I wasn't paying attention. this continued until around 10 or 11, I don't know why that thought process stopped but it just did.

I know my dad was also verbally abusive but I can't really remember specifics I just know it happened often. Things like don't be a pussy or don't be such a girl with the occasional smack upside the head and such. I was a very sensitive child and wished i had been a girl, maybe because my sister didn't get it as bad as I did, I'm not 100% sure why those thoughts started so early but they were vivid.

Around 9 the abuse started changing and progressing into more abrubt violence, less spankings more being thrown against walls and choked although I can remember only two times this happened I wouldn't be suprised if it was more often, smacks across the head, the verbal abuse escalated into more of a bully harassing way, he would do things to just tease or torment me, specific memories are hard to clear up enough to get a good picture, I remember one time he showed me a pressure point on my foot and refused to let go, I was crying it hurt so bad and ended up hitting him in the face and then he lost his temper idk stuff like that. The inappropriate behavior of exposing me to adult things like porn and inappropriate movies, letting me drink a beer or some wine, no sexual abuse I can remember so that's a relief. I started being more aware of his behavior and knowing he was wrong most of the time , I didn't like the way he would treat people in public, he was very racist, he would often put my mom down, they divorced when I was 7. I also started talking back more and challenging him and he seemed to for the most part loose interest in me, I would often leave the house and spend most of the day with friends in the neighborhood. I had very little parental oversight at this point after the divorce and would mainly fend for myself most of the time. By 8 or 9 during summers I was mostly left to do what I wanted, my sister was there but she was a teen and barley kept tabs on me.

My suicidal ideation started around 11 In middle school where I was bullied a lot, the change in the social behavior didn't really click for me until around 8th grade when I taught myself how to be accepted. I started drinking often on weekends in 8th grade, smoking cigarettes by 9th I discovered weed and that was my miracle cure, I couldn't stand ever not being high or drunk and almost all of high-school was just one big party that lasted 10 years too long. I was lucky I never enjoyed the harder stuff besides my love of cocain but it never became too much of an issue. At 15 the end of my relationship with my father happened, he picked me up from school when I was sick and we got in a fight where he punched me several times in the face and I jumped from his moving car, he never got in trouble for it, my mom and sister begged me not to press charges and that was pretty much the end of my relationship with them as well, since the defended him, my sister took his side and my mom who is a push over just wanted the drama to go away and kept trying to get me to forgive him, I lost all respect for either of them and realized I was on my own. That pretty much set up my teen years of balls to the wall not thinking I would live past 18 and to be honest I'm pretty suprised I did, multiple arrests and forced rehab probably ended up saving me. 

I don't know how to feel about all of this, there isn't an emotion to describe any of it, it just makes me feel sick to my stomach. I know it's pretty screwed up but it's hard to see it, it was just my life, that's just what it was."
ptsd,Orgaami,2020/1/6,"Went hunting today...HUGE mistake I was diagnosed with PTSD (childhood and military service trauma related) many years ago and have done EMDR with some success, but am currently looking for a new therapist. 

Today I went deer hunting for the first time in 30 years and shot and killed a ""button buck"" (a male with new antlers barely showing). As soon as I pulled the trigger I felt like I fucked up. The adrenaline and physical reactions from shooting, are the same as what happens to me when I have a PTSD-related reaction (hypervigilance, fight or flight, shaking, nausea, intrusive thoughts, emotional flashbacks, etc.). What the fucking fuck was I thinking?

I've been fucked up about it since and regret / guilt have consumed me all day. I'm not anti-hunting and every part of the animal is being processed for food, but I cannot shake the intrusive thoughts, sadness, nausea, etc., and don't know what to do. Meditation isn't working, binaural audio and physical inputs aren't helping.

ptsd,cleopeace07,2020/1/27,"help please &lt;3 I need some advice on if what i¡¯m experiencing sounds anything like ptsd or if i have just had a traumatic childhood. for context, i just turned 16 and my parents are the cause of this so i can¡¯t really tell anyone about this or get professional help/diagnosis for another 2 years until i¡¯m 18. My whole childhood my parents have really really hated each other and have been constantly screaming at each other, threatening each other, throwing stuff at each other, and dragging me and my siblings into their fights. Two years ago we were driving home from a road trip and my parents got in an extremely bad fight while driving and my dad was looking through my moms phone so she started grabbing to take it back and kind of hitting him, so he called the cops and my mom freaked the fuck out and made him get out of the car.. which is when things got bad. She was speeding and screaming about how my dad was pyscho and then she said ¡°what if i just killed us all right now¡± and proceeded to swerve ALMOST off the road literally a foot away from a tree. in that moment i truly believed my mom was going to kill me and all of my siblings and i remember time going by in slow motion and i felt such extreme disappointment and heartbreak in that moment because i didn¡¯t want to die so young. After my mom swerved, i was in shock and she continued to speed until she was in an empty lot and then she got out of the car and had a mental breakdown screaming at the top of her lungs for 30 minutes while me and my brother and sister stayed inside the car petrified. The cops never ended up finding us and as usual, my parents ¡°made up¡± the next day and acted like nothing had happened. I didn¡¯t realize i was traumatized by it at all until a year later, (last year) i realized how often i would think of her almost killing us and of the perfectly clear image in my head of her headlights shining on the tree a foot ahead of us as she swerved. When i was in cars at night, the road would trigger thoughts and i started to notice i would get extremely anxious and think about the moment my mom swerved and i felt like i was there again. Ever since then, i think about it everyday and when i look at trees that are similar to the ones from that night, or anytime i¡¯m driving at night it triggers me into the flashback-like memory of the event. I was never an anxious person before this but now i am extremely anxious all the time, i have felt depressed for so long i feel numb, and i am constantly reminded of the situation because my parents still fight every day and the noises just bring me back to that car ride. I have never talked about this to anyone because i feel like this event ¡°wasn¡¯t traumatic enough¡± if that makes sense? i also feel bad because my mom is a victim of my dad (who is mainly the bad guy in their marriage) and her actions were really just because he pushed her to the edge that night.. but i still feel like she doesn¡¯t realize at all how much she scarred me and it hurts. i feel so weak that this one night has ruined my life so much and now i rely on weed to prevent the anxiety i have from this now. if you read all that thank you and i¡¯m sorry if it was jumbled!"

ptsd,bunniesok,2020/4/10,"Recently diagnosed by a medical professional I¡¯ve been feeling really fed up and worried about my future because of my anxiety. I had been suspicious of ptsd but hadn¡¯t talked to anyone who could verify until yesterday. My ptsd makes me feel like the weakest human being because it¡¯s not triggered by things most people have been traumatized by. I know some other people have similar triggers because of similar events as me but none of them understand to the extent of mine because they are obsessed with achieving the thing that triggers me. I know that sounds super confusing but I¡¯ll try to explain. 
Trigger warning: triggers ahead possibly. 

In the years 2016-2017 I had 3 miscarriages. 1st was an unplanned and lost without knowledge of it before it happened, 2nd and 3rd were planned and so devastating and plunged my depression deeper. My in laws were indifferent and blamed me a little bit because I couldn¡¯t prevent them. They expected me to move on and accept it as it was. While I was still experiencing my 3rd one, everyone on the in laws side was talking about the fact that another girl in the family was expecting. They had no care in the world that this was continuing to crush my soul as I was already still grieving how unfair the situation felt. 
Before I lost my 3rd, I was excitedly telling my friend (not my friend anymore) that I was amazed at feeling pregnant. After I lost it, she proceeded to brag about how she was having a kid (she never wanted one) and it sent me into a rage and panic. Reliving my loss and angry that someone who didn¡¯t care about motherhood was doing it just because I was so excited before and then oblivious to my pain. 

Everytime I started seeing announcements of having babies, I was sent into a panic I couldn¡¯t control. I kept feeling unreasonably unsafe and al that anxiety stuff. There are a lot more things that added to all this but I really don¡¯t want to explain it all here. 

I know this is nothing like the traumatic events posted here but it¡¯s such a burden in my life and I have nightmares about them so often sometimes I¡¯m afraid to go to sleep. I¡¯m not sure if anyone here will understand but I just wanted a place to let this struggle out now that i know what it is."

ptsd,betterin2015,2020/3/8,"Anniversaries TW: suicide, abuse 


Today is the 5 year anniversary (the irony of my username isn't lost on me but it's an artist reference lol) of my last suicide attempt. I ended up being scheduled to the psychiatric hospital my psychiatrist worked at. My parents were in the first session I had with him after I was admitted and brought *the* note I had written in my diary, but also a passage about an abusive relationship I was in. 


My parents bringing it up resulted in my dad having to hold me while I was sobbing and screaming because this had been the first time I had had it brought up with my parents, and the first time I remember explicitly telling anyone (I ended up being diagnosed with dissociative amnesia after this session because I've completely blacked out any other times I'd talked about it). 


I've been seeing a trauma psychologist for the past 6 months (I haven't been mentally well enough to work on trauma previously) and we're making some progress but if it goes too far in session I become almost catatonic and it's just so frustrating because I feel like I should be over it considering the abuse occured nearly a decade ago (this is something I *only* think about myself, I have a lot more sympathy and compassion for others and would never say this about anyone else).  


Anyways, my body / brain must have subconsciously known this day was coming because I've been getting majorly triggered re: abuse the past month-ish, waking up crying, having nightmares etc. It's just all completely messed up and I guess I just needed to vent because it's doing my head in today."
ptsd,foolishcomputer,2020/3/8,"DAE feel erratic after a therapy session? And if so, what's your personal way of self soothing?

I've noticed recently that the deeper I delve in a session the more likely I am to act out the rest of the week. My brain literally feels like it's a bullet train of emotions or as if fireworks are going off in it. My perception of abandonment, fears, clinginess, and anxiety just heightens..which sucks. My sessions and current therapist do me well with unraveling and tracing behaviours, memories, etc but they leave me in pieces sometimes. This, coupled with being very sober (due to health reasons) really exhausts me.

ptsd,stipd,2020/2/13,"Losing all emotions for people-- Disassociating or sociopathy?? Hello all,

I have a pseudo-diagnosis of PTSD (I say pseudo because it was diagnosed once, by one doctor, and I fit some of the categories but have never really accepted the diagnosis myself) due to a difficult childhood and have many repressed memories/repressed everything.

I have always been prone to disassociating, emotionally, from situations that are unpleasant. In reviewing my childhood I can really say I was numb for the vast majority of it.

As an adult I regained some emotional variability which was been, honestly, unpleasant but feels like it's right.

My question is: I have a bad tendency of becoming 'disappointed' in people or hurt by people and completely, utterly, shutting them out. To the point where long term friendships are broken in an instant and I feel nothing. I feel...dead. I feel a complete absence of emotions. Not anger, not hurt, just nothing. 

It has happened numerous times. It almost feels as though I can't even speak to the person/can't find words when they are around. In one episode I lost a friend because of a hurtful thing they did. After the hurtful thing happened I immediately became numb to them. They tried to talk to me as though nothing had happened (after apologizing) and I just...couldn't. I couldn't talk to them. We remained friendly for a time after that but the relationship was cold and it felt like I could never treat them as anything other than an acquaintance following that episode. Our relationship has never recovered despite the fact that we are in the same friend group and this happened 6 years ago. I, honestly, am not mad, or sad, or hurt anymore that I can feel...I just feel dead.

Why am I like this? Is this a weird subset of disassociating? How do I stop it?"

ptsd,antennaestoheaven,2020/2/10,"Broke up an intense fight at work, need advice I'm a teacher at a, for lack of a better term, urban public high school. I've seen and intervened in my fair share of fights. Last week was different though. I came out of my room after dismissal and saw two boys going after another in the hallway. Teachers were already there, but the campus security was outside dealing with another fight. Right as I entered the hallway the two boys started swinging at the other. The teachers tried to apprehend the two, so I went and grabbed the other one holding him up against the wall.

What I didn't realize is that I had grabbed the one who didn't want the fight to happen, so when the two boys broke free from the other teachers I ended up being a human shield. It's all a blur after that, I just remember them yelling in my face and throwing fists at me and the boy I was protecting. Eventually, other people got involved, but I couldn't move or I was putting the boy in more danger. The only injury I have is a bruise inside my lip, but after my adrenaline settled it triggered some other trauma I have from my parents growing up. Today at work when I looked down the empty hall I almost burst into tears.

What suggestions do you have so that I can go back to my normal self? I've always had trouble with people coming up behind me and I already know this will make things worse."

ptsd,Camm_w,2020/2/22,"Did some progress in EMDR TW: sexual abuse

I'm sorry if this is a long post, there's a lot of backstory and context

So, it's my first time posting, and I just wanted to share with everyone the progress I made last session

I have PTSD from sexual abuse doing my childhood, and only got to find out last year because somehow something unlocked the memories from my brain that were repressed all this time and I remembered it.

I started EMDR to treat it, and when I started I felt like I couldn't do much progress cause I thought ""Im already over it and I have come to accept it"" even though I was having severe symptoms.

A few months passed and I broke down cause I realized I haven't accepted it, and I have never let myself feel the pain, I was still in denail, but it wasn't really fully accepted yet, I started griefing but somehow I was unsure if I invented it myself, I have multiple mental illnesses, that are product of the trauma, and I have been diagnosed with PTSD by multiple professionals but I just wasn't sure if it was true, like I rationally knew the abuse happened and have multiple symptoms, but there was a part of me that couldn't be convinced that I didn't made up the memories and the trauma.

Every time during my sessions when the therapist asked me when picturing the memories what I felt I always said ""anger and disgust"", and then I got a block and couldn't picture the memories anymore.
My therapist explained that I couldn't see them anymore cause once agian it was too hard for me to remember, and that I didn't believed I didn't made it up cause it was still very hard for me to accept that the abuse actually happened to me.

Last week during session when we started I could picture the trauma agian and got really distressed, we stopped and my therapist asked me what we're my feelings, and this time, for the fist time I felt anxious and scared, then I finally told her, ""I didn't made it up, my grandfather did in fact abused me, it did happend to me"". For the first time I fully accepted it and finally believed myself that I didn't made it up as an excuse to my other disorders.

She got really happy and also did I, it was so wonderful to not doubt myself anymore, it was reliefing and she said that this was the biggest breakthrough we've done so far and that now things will get easier and better, I just wanted to share with all of you, it gets better, take care ??.

I'm sorry if I have misspelled something, English isn't my first language."

Cue: coronavirus. We had one session of teletherapy. Then I got an e-mail saying the clinic was temporarily closing because insurance wasn¡¯t compensating teletherapy And once this crisis is over, therapy will resume. (I am in the US in an epicenter.)

This whole situation is making my PTSD spiral. The social isolation, the working from home, the lack of routine and interaction, the total lack of human contact, the catastrophic headlines (due to the nature of my job I cannot avoid them), the revisiting of my own medical trauma and the death of my husband in the hospital, etc. I am so hyper vigilant, so on edge with intrusive thoughts and memories, so easy to startle, and beginning to engage with destructive behaviors. 

Ive been at this game for a while. This is the start of a downward spiral and I need to nip it in the bud because this pandemic isn¡¯t ending anytime soon. 

But I can¡¯t see my therapist and, if my insurance isn¡¯t paying out, I can¡¯t see any one. I am making money but not the kind of money to pay completely out of pocket.

When I was a kid (around 8 years old) I had been through a lot, saw my dad get arrested in front of me (later found out it was a false charge) and my mother ( who constantly got into fights with my dad)  at the time was recovering from a bad car accident. I was usually home alone with my older brother when I got home from school and it was not that great. He would try to act like he was the man of the house and would constantly hit me everytime we got into an argument, even over sibling shit. After I tried to end my life and failed things turned around, we patched our relationship, I reconnected with my father and their relationship got better. Life's been better since then.

Now I can't stop myself from vilantly flinching or cowering everytime someone just as much raises their hand towards me, I don't know what it is and how I can seek help about it.

So I escaped my mom (abuser) almost a year ago and obviously it's been a roller coaster, but some months ago I was starting to be fine, since I started anti depressant and I slept well, having pleasant and funny dreams. But here in January I had to go back to that haunted apartment of my mom's, with my sis and bro-in-law, to pick up the last of my things I couldn't bring with me back then and let's just say, it wasn't quite nice to go back there. Anyways since then till now, I've had nightmares of my mom, the family, that disgusting apartment and my middle school friends almost every night and it's been making my PTSD worse, not to talk about the flashbacks.. This lock down doesn't help either, with me staying at home almost 24/7.

ptsd,friskykitty96,2020/1/20,"Does this sound like PTSD? I know it's always best to see a professional to get a diagnosis, I am currently in the process of it, but I'm just trying to understand my illnesses better. So here I am to share a bit of my experience and get some input. I was mentally abused by my father and was also in a mentally/physically abusive relationship for 3 years. I went to therapy for at least two and a half years. For a while at the age of 11 and after that from 16-17. I was forced to go, so I was never really open during those sessions and didn't want to talk about what I was going through. I was diagnosed with clinical depression during that time. I haven't been diagnosed but I know with absolute certainty that I have anxiety as well. 

Anyway, the reason why I'm thinking I might have PTSD is because anytime anyone yells at me or even just talks loudly, seems mad at me, or just reminds me of my abuse, I COMPLETELY shut down. Worst case, I get a super intense panic attack and start to cry uncontrollably and cannot be calmed down. Shaking, hyperventilating, unable to speak, dry heaving, maybe start hitting myself, my mind just completely breaks. It usually takes me 30 minutes to an hour to be able to think clearly. This doesn't happen that often though, in the past year this has happened maybe 5 times. Usually I might either get a mild panic attack or just feel extremely anxious. Does this sound like PTSD to you?"

It¡¯s so soul-crushing to know that the things you need to pull yourself out of this will forever be denied to you because people see you not as someone who is struggling, in need of help, and worth the time and effort, but rather as a toxicity that they need to cut out of their life."

Eyes that once cried of laughter cry of loneliness,

A tongue that tastes the sweetest things although everything tastes bland lately,

Ears that listened to stories with happy endings, now listen to the emptiness of my fate

A heart that beats when all this soul wants is for it to silence itself,

Hands that pray now hold the blade, 

Please rest this casket beneath the dirt,

Let the earth consume me in an everlasting peaceful nothingness."

I understand that this sort of thing really wouldn't work in real life because people would constantly be trying to talk you out of it, but what if we lived in a world where when life became too much to bear, or there was nothing left you could contribute, you could announce your impending departure and your loved ones would simply gather around to say goodbye.

I applied for a position that's a step up from my current position, and even for internal candidates, we're required to go through the hiring process again, and I went into my interview today, and kept getting called out for being off topic, for not actively listening (I asked what their names were at the end of the interview because I don't remember them introducing themselves at all), and I'm worried that I failed this interview, which means that I won't get the new job which is fine, but I'm worried that because I didn't so well on the interview, I'll be fired from my current job as well.

I'm currently in bed, crying and wondering why I'm alive, and why I didn't kill myself last year, when I was so damn close.

Before I became depressed and still to some extent now, I would shower every single night without question or exception, rain hail or shine, I would shower before bed, and brush + floss my teeth at least twice per day, and usually washed my hands after using the toilet, I felt and still feel very dirty and disgusting when I don't do any of these in a 24h period, yet I've still become apathetic, and seem to forget to do it or not care enough and just take my mind off the dirty feeling and haven't been able to shake it even without a cloud over my head all day.

A company of knights are solemnly striding through the wreckage and their banner is a dying CRT monitor from which a host of wires vomit forth into the shuddering rubber cancer of the power grid and upon the screen can be seen

A low resolution image, a pixel rupture bloom in which can vaguely be discerned the silhouette of a pallid hairless figure, and it slowly turns towards the camera which whines and coughs molten filament in protest at the eyes of the thing which

Flicker through a chemical veil rising from the blistered bones of the buildings, the weeping solar sore brushing the earth with a curtain of incomprehensible colour before

It's gotten me let go from my past few jobs that didn't accommodate my situation after awhile. Collecting disability would force me to swallow my pride and even if I attempted to receive it my chances of getting it would be slim to none since chronic migraines aren't recognized as being that serious of an issue. My newest job has been the best as far as leniancy goes up until the recent policy changes which could see me yet again getting fired sometime in the next few months. There are no charitable foundations in Michigan that help with medical expenses so GoFundMe is my only option outside of family and close friends and I've had to rely on their kindness all too often.

The emptiness is oddly jarring even though it's a common guest throughout my day to day life. I think that in the past even though I generally had that distance from everything I would still feel a little pang of something during special moments and now that even that it isn't happening anymore it just  sends me into this lost confused state instead - like when you're absent-mindedly walking down a familiar staircase and take one step too many and for a moment nothing makes sense."

Introducing: r/AccutaneDamage. Discuss delayed post-exposure toxicity and stories. The damage to your mental and physical health can occur after you stop the drug. So many young men and women have had their mental health damaged, sometimes permanently, by taking accutane (or isotretinoin), even at a normal dose.

Although there's been a long-standing ""controversy"" about whether accutane actually causes mental health issues, there is irrefutable scientific proof that it does indeed change (sometimes permanently) key functions of the brain in multiple ways.

Keep in mind: the ""proof"" that accutane does NOT cause depression (which is, unfortunately, the current conviction of most dermatologists) is industry-funded, poorly conducted research.

If you developed mental health issues (depression, anxiety, suicidality, psychosis, brain fog/cognitive issues, memory issues, OCD, bipolar, schizophrenia, anhedonia, etc), after taking accutane, there is very good reason to believe that accutane directly damaged your brain.

So: Introducing: [r/AccutaneDamage](https://www.reddit.com/r/AccutaneDamage/).

depression,HugeIndication1,2020/3/28,"Getting abused by parents while terminally ill with brain disease At the beginning of high school I developed a very serious neurological disease and began to lose my memory and intelligence eventually developing extremely painful symptoms.

Once the pain began doctors quickly realized I had dysautonomia a serious irreversible neurological condition, which is potentially fatal in certain cases where it continues to progress.

For the past 5 years my family has become extremely cruel and abusive towards me. My family is using false accusations of schizophrenia to cover up the existence of the disease which has already been confirmed at UCLA.

Since my disease is extremely painful i am concerned that when I reach a terminal condition I will be put into a mental hospital left to die without any painkillers.

depression,A2thamuthafukkinK,2020/2/12,"Has anyone ever tried vinpocetine? Vinpocetine used to be an ingredient in pre workout I used years ago and when it was removed there was me huge difference in the overall effect of the product, so much that I quit using the powder altogether as it was now just another over hyped, over priced mix of caffeine, B12, corn starch, and aspartame. 
   It¡¯s long been used in countries like China and India to increase energy and and overall sense of well being with  few adverse effects other than slight dependency when used in moderation, though recent studies have linked it to an increased risk of miscarriage in pregnant women.

It's not direct or intentional selfishness, but rather a by-product. I mean, you spend almost all day consumed with battling your own thoughts and feelings, often to the point where you become completely disconnected from the rest of the world, totally self-involved, but in the worst way. It causes you to forget things like birthdays, that concert that your friend really wanted you to go to, spacing out and counting all the reason your boss thinks you're a loser while Jan from accounting is gushing about her upcoming ski trip. 

And if you live with it long enough, maybe you watch it cripple your social skills and intellect because you're so consumed with existential dread, guilt and despair that you don't have enough mental capacity to pay attention to social cues or spend time being interested in learning about something other than why you're a failure.

Idk, it's a unique kind of selfishness."

depression,RAPTOR115X,2020/4/9,"COVID-19 Is a blessing in disguise for me. I was going to originally post this on a thowaway account like I usually do, but fuck it, I don't care anymore, not that it's relevant, except to point I've posted stuff loosely related to this before and sometimes some more sensitive topics briefly mentioned in this post in more detail.

Just prefacing, the whole people being infected/dying/strain on the world bit is horrible and that's not why it's a blessing in disguise for me.

It's more in the sense that I'm not pressured to look for employment and push myself in my current mental state that has persisted for about 2 years. I've been unemployed since the end of February due to my contract expiring and was not related to the current pandemic, but coincidentally the contract end date was perfectly timed around when this pandemic really started to hit the fan globally, so for however long this shit goes on I don't have the pressure about what the fuck I'm going to do with my life (in terms of career at least) whereas if this pandemic didn't come along when it did I would probably be under huge pressure to perform, whereas that's not currently the case for the time being.

I'm just a depressed 22 year old autistic depressed gender dysphoric nobody who has coasted through life doing what's expected of me (school, job) thus far and have no goals in life (I literally have none and actively don't want any and never have never had any, I don't want to do ANYTHING at all, even if I never had any financial worries again) and just I live in an existence that I never asked for and I'm not allowed opt out of, but despite that I'm expected (correction: forced) to participate in a world/system that I want no part in &amp; cannot realistically escape because my parents decided to fuck each other/have a kid one day. And if I want out (ending my life), my family will be ""sad"" and I will be deemed selfish as my mother says, how the fuck am I selfish for killing myself because you have an emotional attachment to me? But sorry, it's my fucking life, not yours, I'm not here for your emotional needs, I should be the one to have agency on whether or not I should live or not, I shouldn't have an obligation to live a life I don't want to live just to meet your expectations/emotional needs, It's hard to know that parents invest to much into their kid and the pressure to succeed though no choice of the kid, it's not fair. I know for a fact if I could force myself to miscarriage in the womb today, I totally would.

How can a parent have a kid and expect it to live in a world that they did ask to be in and not be given the choice to not live in it if that's their decision, fine, if they want to live, that's not a problem, but being brought into existence not by choice &amp; not being allowed to end that existence early due to selfish parents having an emotional attachment to that child and not thinking about the child's desires (thinking they know best over the child), but their own emotional needs attached to the child

Let's face it, the crux of today's life (in the western world at least, I know less fortunate nations struggle to stay alive at all relative to more opulent nations) for most is having a job to pay taxes, consuming (goods i.e. material goods to make us feel good in the short term but aren't fulfilling) &amp; reproducing to replace yourself, sure, there are those ""little good moments"" at times but the majority of our life is just slaving away to continue to exist until we're too old to continue and a lot of people passively accept it and I just cannot and will not. What's the goal of all of this, just to make the top 1% richer, so they get more worthless paper (money) to flaunt around while people struggle to survive. What is humanity's end goal from all of this, just to keep doing it for the sake of doing it? I hate it when I realize I'm awake again knowing I'm still alive to face another day on this wretched world.

Once this whole pandemic is relatively under control, whether it's 6 months from now, 2 years from now or whenever it happens to be, all those pressures will return (especially considering everyone will be looking for jobs, and I don't stand a chance due to my autism) and I don't know how I'll deal with it if I haven't offed myself by then, and sadly, if I do end up catching COVID-19 chances are due to my age and relatively okay physical health (although slightly obese), I will likely recover (an indirect suicide by infecting myself would be nice and neat if it were likely) I don't want to slave away or be a burden from my parents that overestimate my abilities just to sustain an existence I don't want &amp; didn't ask for. 

Sorry if this became an incoherent/jumbled/tangential rant where I probably repeated things or said the same thing differently, my mind is fucked (autism, depression, persistent gender dysphoria, cognitive decline) and I used to be more eloquent/complex in my thoughts. I'm not long for this would and just want to be out of it."

depression,beautifultragedy13,2020/1/1,"Have to vent, maybe someone can relate.. Long rant...

I've dealt with Depression, generalized anxiety disorder, OCD, body dysmorphia  and other issues for over 12 years now,. It effects every facet of my existence and their doesnt seem to be an end or any hope in sight, things have only gotten worse.

 Ive taken numerous medications, have been through antidepressant withdrawal syndrome, countless doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, mental health facilities and im still unwell and feel so alone, disgusting, unloveable,outcasted, judged and have to  constantly put a mask and facade on everytime I leave the house, acting in the opposite way to how i feel inside for some reason as I can't not act that way, with a smile on my face, laughing, lying about how i spend my days and my worth as society deems a person's  worth.

 Always undermining my own pain because I dont want to be perceived differently by others, disliked and be that negative person people dont want to be around which has left me trapped through years of using this coping strategy.
 
It's extremely draining and has isolated me even more but I can't change it, people cant possibly understand and never will, its not as black and white as people think it is, its a spiderweb of complexities built over many years that words will never be enough to explain.
you cant explain a kaleidoscope to a blind man.

 theyll never see, feel and experience it as you do.

Ive never looked for sympathy from others or exaggerated my pain for attention, as i know how i feel and the strength and resilience its taken for me to carry myself in a manner that I do, where many people wouldn't  even know that I deal with mental illness, feeling the way i do everyday, still friendly, loving and accepting to everyone while constantly being shit on and criticized in response to me opening my heart up and being sensitive confirming over and over again my perception of myself and my self worth.

I have a loving family and a few  friends that have some level of understanding and even though I have thoughts  of suicide every day I'm not going to take my life as i know how badly it would destroy my loved ones and I'm too afraid to do it too.

Saying that though the past year I've found myself every night going to bed and really fuckin hoping i dont wake up.
That way I can't be blamed and feel shame and cowardly for taking my own life and obviously it's one of the best ways to pass in my opinion too.

I'm doing drugs more often to escape my everyday hell as its becoming harder to deal with and nobody knows, Ive become very good at hiding things and putting on an act, but i dont want to be doing drugs at all.

I think i partake in risky and self destructive behaviour as if i die from it, it's not the same as me hanging myself or ending my life in such a manner
and of course it will still destroy my family, but at least theyll know I didnt do it with my own hands purposely  and in such a tragic way that they'll question why i did it and feel like they could of done something and were someway responsible, for the rest of their lives.

People care for a while, but unlike other illnesses that you get better from after a period of time, such mental illnesses ive mentioned are continuous and nobody wants or has the time or energy to deal with your illnessess for years on end.
They forget, as they dont live with it as you do everyday, its not their reality and they expect a change in attitude and their patience and understanding wears thin, expecting you to act as if you're not sick after a while.

Theres only so much someone can take, we all have our own lives and struggles to deal with.

If you have the flu for example, people can be accommodating and supportive  for a week or two, but what if you had the flu for 10 years, they'll stop giving a shit like they used to and somewhat unknowingly, treat you as if your normal and are expected to act normal,  doubting the severity of your condition especially if you are able to carry yourself well while feeling like death inside, sometimes it makes me want to show others how i really feel inside and be non talkative, never smile, laugh or socialise, insread of forcing fake emotions I don't feel and that maybe if I act hateful, hardened  and express my pain physically, people will take my illnesses a bit more seriously instead of gossping about me, making assumptions and undermining my emotions, they might see my lashing out as an expression of how much I'm hurting, but either way I'll still be labelled and crtisized because most are unable to truly empathise as they don't have the ability to comprehend the realities physically and mentally of people, outside their own.
 or don't want to try and understand, so youre made to feel like your suffering is nothing compared to what others go through so you should stop whinging and try to better yourself, until you kill yourself then all of a sudden people are so shocked and care so much.
I'll leave it there, its far more complex and theres way more to it that im able to articulate through words, somethings cant really be translated."

With uni exams looming in February, and having just spent my whole winter holidays tending to my dementia sick Grandmother, bless her, and now being in the same, sick, situation I was in last new years, all I can see is black. The impact that this has had in the past year of my life has been immeasurable, it halted my education, halted my relationships, halted my involvement in trips, friend meet ups, parties, and even simply doing sports.

I was lucky enough to get back in touch with my therapist a few weeks ago, however this holiday seems to have undone all the progress we made, thoughts about suicide, tiredness, reluctance to any activity and days filled with the same feeling that I can only describe as the feeling one has when something merits a disappointed sigh.

into depression I isolate myself by exaggerating the flaws in my relationships with friends/family and using those as justification to distance myself from them. As I become more isolated I tend to perceive neutral gestures as more hostile. Everyone is percieved as the enemy. From an evolutionary perspective I guess that sorta makes sense. If a cave person were to be separated from their tribe they would be very vulnerable and it would be advantageous to percieve more interactions as threatening as isolation world mean constant danger. However in modern society this state of hyper awareness to threats ends up usually just further isolation vulnerable people because it makes them more likely to lash out and eliminate the few connection they have left."

I read so many comments on Reddit that people are depressed, anxious and continually questioning the choices they make in life. I am convinced the root cause of many of these problems is social media (though it is not mentioned by posters), as they mention what their friend and family are doing/ achieving.

The article mentioned does an excellent job of breaking down the social issues caused by previous generations and how individuals operate in a society in the digital age. It explains expectation vs reality, how""Lucy"" see's how her life should be, her perception of her friends and family's life.... and the reality of her existence and her friends existence.

I ask those who read the article to consider what they get from social media and if the positive outweighs the negative, considering the impact it has on your mental health.

I deleted my Facebook, Instagram and Twitter years ago. I still have Linked In for work, but the anonymity provided by Reddit and quite frankly the content is far superior to any of the other platforms, making it a far better choice for your mental health.

depression,BriefAstronomer6,2020/1/28,"I have difficulty utilizing ""coping strategies"" because of bad experiences with therapists I had my first psychiatrist when I was around 9, he was an extremely old man who perpetually sounded like he was on the verge on death. Perhaps not surprisingly, he could not relate to my 9 year old's problems and his solution to every problem was simply ""take sleeping pills.""

When I was in my early teens, I got involved in a more intensive treatment plan and went to a special school for mental health care. I was on a variety of anti-depressants, none of which had any effect except (I suspect) damaging my sexual ability, but my requests to stop taking them were always rejected. 

The school was hellish to me¡ªany expression of negativity gets your privileges further restricted as you're seen more and more as an uncooperative and incompetent person who is too mentally ill to advocate for themselves. I've literally seen a student get pulled aside and scolded for starting a conversation with a friend with, ""I got banned from Reddit last night-"" because it was ""negative.""

Coping strategies and CBT are forced onto you, if you try to say ""this particular strategy is not very effective for me personally,"" or ""I don't want to use x strategy right now, I think y strategy would be more helpful,"" or ""I'm not currently stressed and I don't need to use any of these,"" you get threatened with punishment. 

It becomes extremely uncomfortable to have to constantly watch your speech in case something is deemed inappropriate, and failing to fly under the radar risks you being forced to live in a sort of psych ward for children where they have really restrictive and often arbitrary rules (""drinking chocolate milk at lunch specifically is not allowed""). I could go on about this, but to sum it up, there's a lot of forced ""treatment"" and restriction on autonomy that really harmed my self-esteem.  


I have since appeared to have made a full recovery from depression because I wanted to get away from all this, but in reality I am still struggling immensely with it. It is extremely difficult for me to cope with stress because thinking about anything that has been forced upon me makes me feel awful from remembering my experience there. I would like to get a therapist once I'm in a living situation that makes it more convenient, but I'm really worried about them ending up like previous ones I've had."

It's not really about me instead more about Nikol, but i would appreciate everyone's advice and support!

(also i'm not sure if this is the right community and honestly really don't know where to start the story, because it's way too bizarre to understand or believe it, but i'll try anyway)

Nikol was born with cancer, is allergic to the sun, has bad luck in life and is innocent since always, because her parents have never loved or cared about her, all they ever did was abuse mentally + physically and talk bad for no reason, her father is actually not really her father, because she had a blood test and the result was that her mother was with her ""uncle"", her younger brother stole her Nintendo Switch and never gave it back, she never got money support from her parents that she needed for school / university + not even lunch, the whole ""family"" are bunch of irresponsible rude people, the only good thing that Nikol had in life was her dear late Grandmother who took care of and raised her to be an honest, good and heartwarming person.

I always liked Nikol, because she is a wonderful, interesting, smart, etc. person and did everything I could to help so that she has a better life that she deserves like to help her mentally, gift her a good bed so that she no longer has back pain, laptop so that she has it for university, cell phone so that she does not become alone and can talk with me, switch so that she has fun, a rabbit that gives her joy, etc. etc. etc. I know it would sound like a scam at first sight, but for me it's not, because no one really got to know her that well, but i really know and talk to her almost everyday and that it's not a waste so i'm the one who helped out and bought all the stuff that she needed in life and that i really don't care about money or that she never would dare to ask me about doing all that in the first place, but it showed how grateful Nikol really is with tears of joy, because of my kindness. I also took good care (for a short time) of her late Grandmother, paid for a proper grave and promised her before that that i will take care of and protect Nikol so that she doesn't have to worry anymore which made her happy and feel at ease until the end.

Nikol should be happy and if she dies, then everything was for nothing and I really love her and want her to live so I only believe that I can help her and that she needs me, but now I just don't know where to start, Nikol was really (/always) depressed (because her life was already bad enough thanks to her family) + suicidal since the accident which was 2 months until the trauma amnesia started, now she can't recognize me anymore and it's really hard for me to accept the truth, so i would really appreciate everyone's help!

depression,Notpan,2020/2/14,"Treatment resistant depression - psychiatrist recommends admission to research/academic hospital - where to go from here? With a 10+ year history of consistent depression, sprinkled with suicide attempts throughout, and having tried a dozen anti-depressants, I was told at a recent inpatient hospitalization by the attending psychiatrist there that I would likely need a more ""sophisticated"" facility to be treated for treatment resistant depression. She said like a research or academic hospital, ones that do ECT, TMS, and other elevated (perhaps even experimental) forms of treatment (she mentioned ketamine, but said she didn't know enough about its long term effects to recommend it). She mentioned Stanford, Vanderbilt, or Duke as examples. However, she said they would be unable to transfer me directly from the crisis stabilization unit to one such hospital and that I would need to be referred to such a hospital through an outpatient program. 

I have since been discharged from the hospital and spoke with my outpatient doctor, whose facility has no experience with referring patients to a research hospital. She advised me to do the research and choose a hospital that I would like to be referred to and they would do all they can to help.

I'm posting here to see if anyone has had any experience with this process and can offer any advice as to what hospital to choose, what to expect, or any helpful information about what to do in my case.

A sailor has decided to sail the seven seas with a wooden boat with all the essentials and couple of plank of wood just incase something happens to the boat, as he was sailing he notice a small crack that is leaking water, he takes a minute to think if he should fix it with a plank of wood he has or he just fill it with anything, but in the end he decided to put a tape over it and call it a night, couple of hours go by he goes to check he sees that the crack is slightly bigger than before and thought maybe the tape didn't work and I should fill it with something bigger, so he decided to turn shove his can of soda into the hole and call it for the day, he returns the next day and sees the hole is even bigger than before and this time he decide to shove his packet of cigarettes into the hole and hope for the best, as the days goes he goes on to shove more things such as alcohol, his food, money and more and more but never considered to use his plank of wood as he is afraid there might be something bigger that he uses it for. Weeks go by and he ran out of things to shove in that hole and as his ship is completely empty and sinking unable to fix it he sits down as he is drowning and starts to reflect on his life and what could have been if he just decided to place a plank of wood over it rather than fill the emptiness with things that does not help the scenario.

If you are reading this, stop blaming things and start working in yourself. You will never fix the emptiness you are feeling with alcohol and drugs or whatever, sit down and take your time to realise that your life issues could have been fixed if you correctly tried rather than blame things and be lazy about it.

depression,life-is-not-money,2020/4/2,"Want a superpower? Ask someone a deeply felt question, hold eye contact, and thoroughly listen without judgment Someone once asked me a profoundly simple yet revealing question: ""how is your freedom going?"" 

It cut through all the pretense. Being financially independent isn't total freedom. Being educated, meaningfully employed, and in love with another human being are all elevating, but they aren't an account of freedom. 

Freedom might be realized, among other ways, as being unhindered and unencumbered by attachments, released from incessant and unfulfilled desires, unperturbed by negative cognitive patterns; moving through life with spontaneity and peaceful acceptance, finding one's default state as intrinsically content without having to engage or consume externality,   

Methinks this is a kind of therapy: long conversations in nature, affectionate touching, laughter, and intimately playful associations that are beyond pragmatic superficiality. When the televisions and distractions are paused, and the main event becomes human companionship.

depression,Growfield,2020/4/3,"Am I actually depressed? I have long had a general attitude towards myself that could (at least on the surface) be attributed to depression. I have no love for myself, I generally dislike people, I don't have any qualms against speaking vulgarly, pessimistically and hatefully for people in general and especially myself, partially medicated social anxiety and I have no motivation whatsoever to do anything productive. The closest things that resemble a ""passion"" for me include very niche areas that are typically considered hobbies, such as roleplaying tabletop games, free writing, a fascination with encyclopedias and wikis that borders on an internet addiction and just general surreal, undisturbed absurdity where I can just melt into a world of crass un-logic where I can giggle at silly shitposts and obscure (or not so obscure) pop culture references as memes.

But am I really depressed, or is it some other ""disorder"" like a bizarre introspective circlejerk of a superiority/inferiority complex?  Or, more likely, am I just lazy? I do, after all, have a perfectly intact (albeit dry) sense of humor, no suicidal tendencies and good familial relationships. My performance at school is a mixed bag of gaining excellent marks in certain sporadic areas and having mediocre to failing marks in many others. What in the nine hells is wrong with me?

I¡¯m  posting here specifically   because our     long term goal is to change the  composition of our   entry pool to     include more entries featuring diverse  characters and   themes. These     voices need to be heard, and we are  actively   reaching out to find  them.

We are currently looking for new talent in humor poetry, short fiction and essay:

[The Wergle Flomp Humor Poetry Contest](https://winningwriters.com/our-contests/wergle-flomp-humor-poetry-contest-free)offers  a first prize of $1000, a second prize of $250, and ten       honorable  mentions of $100 each.

We'll be continuing with  this effort   in   order  to  keep trying to get as many people into the  national  and     international  conversation on literature as we can.

Sometimes        when I post, there are some replies worried about a scam, so in     order    to head that off I just want to say that our competitions are     listed  by   The Write Life as some of the [top writing competitions out there](https://thewritelife.com/writing-contests/), and we¡¯re in Writer¡¯s Digest¡¯s [top eight sites for writers](https://www.writersdigest.com/online-editor/top-websites-for-writers-best-publishing-marketing-resources).

depression,kanshi14,2020/2/21,"Depression and insecurity with online friends. I get dependent/intimate with a friend, set up boundaries as to what makes it a good friendship. I get intimidated when they spend time with other people, worry about abandonment because I can't compete or compare against others. My father was an alcoholic and abandoned me before I really knew him, 8 years ago I saw him at his deathbed and that stuck with me vividly though, although I'm not sure in his hospitalized state if he knew who I was, I'm sure that's why I feel like this somehow.

I feel incapable of feeling secure and warm affection without a venomous vice of paranoia and fear of being too dependent, I always expect betrayal and distrust the people I like to an extent. I try to control or manipulate people into just ""belonging"" to me or to avoid those I feel intimidated by. I'm aware of this which should help, but instead I'm disgusted and filled with self-loathing and that I can't seem to stop myself from letting my emotions rule me because I always give in to the paranoia, it feels endless. I get sick and my body feels like lead when I think about my friend with others.

I'm reassured by my friend that even if they do stuff with others me and him will always be close, but I spoil our relationship with my paranoia and I feel like I need to drop contact for his and my benefit.

This has been going on for months now and I feel like I'm in a black pit, this morning I started a journal entry as I've heard that can be therapeutic but all my efforts to improve my life just don't seem to be working quick enough."

depression,Scambled_Seawater,2020/2/15,"On my way out For all my years as a depressed teen, I've never felt as anxious and broken as I do now as an 'adult'. My parents charge me my entire paycheck for the privilege of existing in their house, offering me a share bunk bed with my hormonally charged younger brother or the street corner. My job is largely unsatisfying, as I come home with nicks, cuts, and burns every shift with nothing to show for it, and my rostering manager sees me as an uncommitted bad employee (despite me covering shifts that were ditched at the last minute every week). In my friendships, I'm always the planmaker/engager, and when I don't start a dialogue, people are content with ignoring me and treating me as part of a non-existance, and no-one sees me as a viable romantic interest no matter how 'funny' or 'cool' they describe me as. I'm constantly gas lighted by my mother, as she projects all of her issues from her unsatisfying relationship to me, leaving me with a constant ticker in the back of my head saying ""maybe this is my fault"", and thanks to my stepdad who only leaves the shed to have a go at someone I now flinch whenever I hear a door close or open too fast. I have a suicide method planned for every venue I frequent, and yesterday on Valentine's Day here In Australia I nearly jumped from the bridge on my 8km walk home into the path of an oncoming train. I'm new to this subreddit, but I feel like I need to type something so I feel like I exist on more planes than just my imagination, or at least because it's a novelty that hasn't already been dulled like my other hobbies that I used to enjoy.

depression,turtleinatardis,2020/2/26,"Agomelatine Sexual Side Effects Apologies if this is the wrong place to post this, but I am a little lost trying to find information and would appreciate any help people can give. 

Hiya, so I have been diagnosed with OCD/anxiety, and I also suffer from mild-moderate depression. I have been discussing antidepressants with my GP, and I am considering asking for agomelatine/valdoxan. My main concerns with medication are: no sexual side effects, and no extensive tapering needed when stopping the medication. I have tried mirtazapine but found the zombie like foggy feelings too much to tolerate, and I am in the UK so Wellbutrin is not an option.  

Agomelatine seems to fit my criteria, but I have come across a couple of anecdotes about sexual side effects developing after a longer period of time on this medication, and I wanted to ask if anyone could give me more information/any more anecdotes regarding sexual side effects of this drug. I know it is generally considered to have very few sexual side effects, especially compared to other antidepressants, but I want to understand if this means essentially no potential for such side effects, or just a very low incidence.

Furthermore, I am aware that sexual dysfunction can persist after stopping medications such as SSRIs and SNRIs. Does anyone know if there is a similar risk with agomelatine? Sexual dysfunction is something I have struggled with in the past, and I am absolutely unwilling to risk potentially permanent side effects, so I want to be aware before discussing with my doctor since he is not overly informed about the exact side effects of particular psychiatric medications. 

Thanks in advance :)"
depression,GrimpaJ,2020/1/9,"Suicide by Iboprofen I've read different things now and therefore am pretty confused what is actually true...

I've read on for example [this website](https://www.recovery.org/learn/visualizing-killer-doses/) that Iboprofen can be lethal (at a dose of 24g). Which would mean that if you buy just 2 times the 50-pieces-packages of 400mg Iboprofen (which you can buy without any prescription for only around 5), you would have 40g of Iboprofen - which is far more than the fatal dose.

But [other websites](https://www.t-online.de/gesundheit/id_53344468/schmerzmittel-bei-ueberdosierung-droht-der-tod.html) (sorry it's in german) state that Iboprofen isn't fatal. On the same website it is mentioned that other painkillers like Paracetamol can be lethal - but the process of dying from it is extremly painfull (because the liver is decomposed / corroded) and takes some time (several days) until you're dead... which is not the ideal way of dying in my opinion.

Websites like [this report](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1550881/) state that Iboprofen can be lethal - but only in very rare cases.

&amp;#x200B;

So as you can see, there are different sources claiming even the opposite information compared to each other... At first Iboprofen seemed to be very promising because it is easy to get and extremely cheap as well (especially compared to ""safe fatal medication"" like Pentobarbital which you can only get from the Darkweb and extreme prices).

&amp;#x200B;

Do you know anything about the use of Iboprofen for suicide? Or do you have any similar easy to get &amp; cheap medication that is suitable for suicide?"

depression,Diealrod,2020/3/5,"I don't really think if one phrase could even describe how destroyed am I I don't even know how to start, I always thought about one thing that always tortures my brain: Everyone are the same, but I am not. When I was a child, being child was the perfect excuse to hide my condition: I don't know how to talk to people, I don't know how to prolong a conversation, I don't know anything about being sociable. In the other hand, I was (and I am) really smart, but I don't really qualify myself about something special, because people are so stupid to think about being self-centered, instead of thinking about the personality itself, that's maybe one of the thing I don't even comprehend about society, well I continue, being able to do whatever you want its something amazing, I felt (I feel) I got the most powerful superpower, being able to think about something interesting to do and make it real, make it like I was professional on something, but if you can't even talk, even express yourself, your brain, all of your amazing ideas are taking down to trash, to something miserable, how much kids, teens worried about the things other people say (I worry too), but I'm 100% sure they can shine if they are with the correct people, ask me, I'm 22 now, in 22 years, Why didn't I find anyone like me?, anyone who I can talk about interesting things and not about superficial and stupid things, anyone who takes the life like a poetry, with right values, anyone who understands me, anyone who I can be myself

I hated my school partners, and they always thought about things on how to ruin my day, I didn't understand why being so small, being so tiny they were so disrespectful to each other, I lived on a city that I can't even pronounce it's name because is the reason of all my misfortunes, people so damn vulgar, so damn low they can't even teach their kids how to be kind, how to be respectful to anyone. I learn about pride, that keep me away from bullying, they don't even know why they bullied me, bullies tend to attack people about their body, about if they are stupid, about a condition, they just attack me because it was me, and I know, they smell it like dogs, possessed maybe, because I didn't find a reasonable reason to understand what they bullied me, but in the middle of that, I thought why just can't we be friends? Why do we attack to each other? Only because I can't be vulgar like you? They is the reason why I hate my ethnicity, this stupid language called spanish talked only by freaking stupid people, because I learned about they, every single piece of word they say, why my country is infested with third-world-people, they are way too worried about lgbt and inclusiveness, why didn't they included me on society?

There was a guy, Alvaro C. was and still is his name, he was the most disgusting, profane, putrid and revolting person I ever met, he was just a compulsive masturbator, obsessed with pornography, I remember when he checked the teacher computer just for looking for sexual content, when he masturbates in class, I couldn't care less about his life except for one thing, he didn't let me breathe one miserable day when I was in school, he just looked for me to having some daily fun, let's make this piece of s**t even more s**t than he actual is he thought, I cried trying to understand why me? what did I got in myself that makes me so despreciable?, he didn't know about what thing inserted in my mind, now I'm him, now it's me who have a problem with porn addiction

When I was 14, I decided to play guitar, not only that, now I'm feeling that I'm able to put some music on the radio with some effort and money, but I don't have the energy left to do something, actually I just don't have energy to do nothing more than just laying in my bed and watching these repulsive videos that I hate, but I can't left behind for some reason, this thing is just consuming my brain, all my abilities, my smartness, my heart, my soul, I want to leave it but I'm thinking that I have no reason to do that, because for me now life is just pointless, is just about being stupid, thinking stupid, talking stupid, living stupid, don't try to be some special for this world because this world will take you and make you descend down to their level, descend down to hell, and if you make it to the top maybe it's because you are like they by default, I got ideas, still have some beautiful ideas, but I'm alone, waiting for someone to help me that will never come, suicide is just a boring option, I know if I just die no one will notice and I hate that, I will not take that option because I don't want to give them the pleasure of that, it's freaking hypocrite when these criminals of society cry to a fallen relative, cry is a emotion just for good people so you know now why they don't cry me but instead cry to themselves, you may not believe in God, but you can make sure the Devil is in one of us waiting just for destroy everyone else and every piece of you, disguised as everything you know, the more you think everything is normal, the more you are far away from comprehend that life, this world f***ing hates you, that's not a advice, that's what I understood in 22 years."

I come from Romania, an ex-comunist european country that is still trying to develop and is renewed for having the worst medical system in the European Union, some of the biggest rates of povertyness and also lowest wages in the EU. The thing is, that in my childhood and early teenages, I didn't pay that much attention to my teeth. I ate a lot of sweets and sugar, and also, untill when I was about 12 years old, I didn't regulary brushed my teeth(my parents lived, and they still live from paycheck to paycheck) and didn't always afford to buy me a toothpaste for several days or weeks, depending on when the money from their wage was ove. And even afther then, while I brushed them more, I didn't use floss or mouthwash, and now I can see the effects of those days on my teeth.

This summer I started studying software engineering at a good public college in my country(somehow made it out here afther hard work and succeded to get a state funded scolarahip here). While the university has a dedicated dentist, it can only do fillings for free, the rest of the work needs to be paid, but the problem is that a lot of my teeth were so damaged that the needed to be extracted and right now, i have 4 extracted teeth, another 3 that need extraction, but didn't get them out so far, my top front teeth are crooked and chipped because they needed large fillings in them, and even though in the last few months I tried to take more care of them, right now, manny of my teeth are unable to be recovered. 

Right now my parents can't afford to repair my teeth, they are working hard right now to keep me at this college, the city is expensive for us, my mother is not working because she needs to take care of my sister( she is 6 years old and we don't have anybody else to take care of her), so we are 4 people living from one wage of about 450 plus my scholarship that barely allow me to pay the rent and buy some food. I would like to work part time to make some money, but computer engineering is a very hard degree, so that will probably make me unable to concentrate on college, make me lose my scolarahip, and probably ruin my only chance to succeed in life. But I would really like some veneers or dental implants, but the problem is that they are expensive for us, each dental implant cost over 400, and the veneers cost about 350 for each tooth, while the average monthly net wage in Romania is less than 500. 

Right now i'm in a bad mental state, I made some friends here at the college, and while they didn't say to me anything about my teeth, they are in my head everyday, making me thinking about what they might think about my teeth. I don't smile with my teeth out, when I talk I try not to show them , and, sometimes, when I try to talk to my friends, they don't understand what I try to say because of this. Beside this, I also have problems chewing food because of my missing teeth, I have problems biting because of my crooked front teeth with fillings, and i'm afraid to aproach any girl because i'm self aware of my teeth and I'm afraid that they will reject me when they see my teeth. While my future job domain is (hopefully) well paid, the worst thing right now is that I can't really do anything for the next 4 years to improve my teeth. It might not really be a depression, but i'm really sick of this, and I would really like to have normal teeth so I could have really normal life that doesn't imply being self aware and ashamed all the time about my teeth, a life where I won't get rejectes from the girls I try to approach  saying that I don't take care of my appearence and my teeth and also say to me that i'm poor. I don't know what to do, i'm really sick of this thing, and I really needed to write this long post to get everything out of my chest. Any advice is welcome."

depression,IRockThatCockDock,2020/2/27,"A house full of people is the loneliest place to be M21. Currently sitting in the spare bedroom, in the dark, crying. I've been fighting against my seasonal depression for the past few months as I do every year, and since Christmas I think I'm basically at the lowest I have ever been. 

The worst thing is is that I've actually been trying to talk about it this year, and the only two things I asked my girlfriend to do to help me was to spend some time together before bed to just talk and to spend time talking on the phone when I'm working away from home. These last few weeks, she has done nothing to help me and has completely fallen through on these promises (I have literally talked to her for less than 10 minutes today, she is currently downstairs watching television, not doing anything worthwhile). I've essentially spent all of this time on my own in the room, but this week is the first time in a long while that I have been able to feel enough of anything to actually cry, and while it feels good to have an emotion back, I wish it made me feel better than this.  I swear that the biggest mistake I ever made was moving in with my girlfriend, but I know she feels differently. I'm honestly tempted to break up with her, just so this loneliness that is my life currently will be on my own terms, and not because the people around me don't care enough to check on me when I've told them that I'm not far off breaking point. 

My main hobby got taken away from me due to money restraints in October, I have absolutely no outlet for anything myself. I have no money for myself, the small bit left after bills and taxes goes to saving for some sort of future that I don't even see myself being in.

I hope everyone else can start to feel better, I don't care about myself anymore because I know that whatever I say, the health profession in my country will tell me that it will be over in a couple of months and I can go back to being normal (like it won't come back 6 months after that again, what sort of life is that)."
depression,emco619,2020/3/26,"Mental Health Awareness and Coronavirus Clinical Depression is something i have always struggled with, however our society makes it such a taboo topic, that I cannot even speak about it. It makes me fight my own thoughts everyday, and I have no one but myself to tell. 

Now that the COVID-19 has been placing everyone around the world on lockdown, I have been seeing posts about reaching out to others for social support, and others claiming they are depressed because they cannot see their friends for however long. While it is important to reach out to those struggling with the lockdowns, part of me struggles to feel empathy for them. I understand that no one truly knows what others are going through, and without a doubt there are others like me who are struggling and feel like they cannot tell others, but these posts are troubling to me. 

It makes me realize that mental health is not spoken about in our society, and as someone who has struggled with it for years, it is truly upsetting that a pandemic is the one thing that has sparked awareness for it. It feels like only when the masses feel this way, then we have to make others aware and have to tell others to support their peers. When the outspoken few who struggle with it daily for indefinite periods of time try to bring awareness, we are told that we are crazy, and that we should not speak of it. 

Its just upsetting to me that it is only now that this is gaining traction, because it feels like when everyone who feels isolated or sad during the lockdown goes back to their daily lives, we will still be here, with no one willing to listen. Is it wrong to feel this way?"

Usually when I'm feeling this depressed, I have a lot of thoughts and worries running around in my head, but I'm always hesitant to vent them to other people (who I know are willing to help), because I fear they will come off as 'small problems' and they'll elict the awful response of 'how are you this caught up on something so small?' Even though I know those people wouldn't say that at all...

depression,ComicsAndNoir,2020/1/17,"The Distorting Lens of Depression One thing I leaned during my treatment for depression is that depression changes not only the way you think, it also changes the way you see the world.

It can be a hard thing to describe if you haven¡¯t experienced it, but one way to think about it is that depression places a lens between you and the world around you. This ¡®lens¡¯ changes the way you perceive the world and, to a greater or lesser extent, it changes everything. But you don¡¯t know this is happening.

It can be hard to ¡®see¡¯ that you have depression, since the disease itself distorts your view of the world. It¡¯s a prison where every wall is made of tinted glass. Things can seem hopeless, they can seem that there¡¯s no opportunity for improvement, but this is wrong.

depression,blueskyredplanet,2020/3/13,"My perspective Please listen to me and don¡¯t ban before listening. All of this anguish, pain, self doubt, and hopelessness has cursed us, we have even been thrown into the darkest depths of emotional emptiness, nothing to fight for, nothing to live for, there seems like there is no salvation, we are abandoned. Trust me I¡¯ve felt it. 

But isn¡¯t it beautiful, isn¡¯t it the most poetically glorious thing, when the soldier walks through the trenches of hell, through bombardments of demonic fire,  the strongest adversary he has ever faced in his life, losing friends and limbs. It seems like he will never be whole again, but forty years later, maybe fifty, he is sitting in his old wooden chair, his grandchildren playing in the yard, and finally, there it is, strangely... peace, freedom, everything he had fought through has led him here, but he had to fight like hell, he had to push through, he had stared death himself in the face and had the guts to stick it to him. 

Why let it all go now? Yes you may never be able to achieve your ultimate dreams, yes you may never meet your dream  partner, yes you may not even reach your goals or the expectations of others, no matter how hard you try, that¡¯s reality, but that¡¯s just how it is, but there IS a life out there, and it¡¯s better than death, one that isn¡¯t as painful and shit and unbearable as it is now, there 100 percent is, maybe as a school teacher, maybe even a construction worker with all your construction worker buddies, maybe you find something you are good at, Ju jitsu, painting, music, maybe you find a friend you love spending time with, maybe you finally meet a girl or boy with great effort, maybe step by step after years you overcome the social anxiety, maybe you build yourself in the gym and form a body you never thought you could have, maybe you could get a job that you are atleast content with, and you can use that money to help and improve others, it may not be a life of glamour, but it¡¯s something. And when you set those goals, and you work towards them with everything you have, every single hour, second put in, with every blood sweat and tear poured in and you finally make it, with little goals like this, wouldn¡¯t it feel infinitely better? 

And when you had walked through the roaring fires like those soldiers before you, and you¡¯re standing on the peak, the peak you have for yourself, you will know that you have made it, you made something of your life, there isn¡¯t only emptiness, at that point, I promise, it will have all been worth it. 

The weak die by giving up, suicide? No such thing, that is pathetic, we all fade away in the end, no matter where you are or where you who you will end up like those who have given up, but what differienciates you? You fought, you stayed when those weaker than you couldn¡¯t, be rich or die trying, be happy or die trying, you have the right to be happy, and if this life derives you of it, the FIGHT, you may not make it, but atleast you didn¡¯t go out like a coward and who knows, maybe you will make it, if not now, than in 20 or 30 or 60 years but it will and can happen!"

i find myself lost in my emotional thoughts lately and have some suicidal thoughts.havent talked to my wife about this but have confided in my younger sister who went through depression herself.i cant seem to bring myself to talk to my wife about my emotional wellbeing ever since we've had quarrells about our financial situations.i'm currently still running the business which must still run its course till at least another 6months and have been driving a taxi service part time much like uber in my home country but i just cant find the motivation to get out of bed for work.have thought about ending it all because nothing seemed to matter to me anymore.not sure if the stress about the business or just a demon in me but i find myself couping up at home alot more often than usual and do find myself wanting to cry at night.i smoked more,cared less,talked less,smiled less,gamed more(gaming was one of my go to for destressing),slept more,ate more and worked less. sometimes i find myself unable to even get up for a shower and have skipped showering for a few days before i drag myself into the bathroom and even when i do i spend way more time in the shower than ever,almost 2 hours for a shower which usually takes me about 15mins.i barely find myself talking to my wife about even the most mundane things and she's even suspecting of me having depression but i'm not able to open up to her.sometimes i feel like just shouting out loud for someone to help me but i'm not even sure how they could even start.i dont know where to find help."

This lasted for years and then I hit a turning point and started figuring things out and improved my overall happiness.  
A few years ago I started learning about positive psychology to continue to learn systems to help me live with as much joy as possible. I continued to read books and become a certified coach along the way.  


During this time of uncertainty and being stuck in the damn house all the time, I see myself having similar feelings¡­ but it¡¯s totally different now as I¡¯m able to recover from negative feelings much quicker and not get caught up in them.

depression,TheRealMossBall,2020/2/18,"[Serious hypothetical] Would you be interested in meeting up with other people struggling with depression to play video games once a week? This is inspired by a post I saw yesterday and a comment I made in response. Someone from this community offered to play video games with others, and it attracted a lot of responses. So I wanted to put this out there:

If there were a public place where you could go for free that was designed/advertised for people with depression or other mental illnesses to meet up and play video games (imagine like a community center room full of tables with different consoles, perhaps a game-room-style game library where you check out different games and return them to a desk at the end, BYO memory card or cartridge if you just wanna play your own save file but with others) and possibly board/tabletop games, would you go?"
depression,fleecehat,2020/1/2,"Fuck School. Quick breakdown of the American School System:

45% - useless information that's only going to be slightly useful in extremely niche fields of work/study or situations. 

45% - outdated and bullshit information from a 20th century textbook that's being taught by someone who might even know less about the subject than you or at least cares about it less than you. 

10% - good info/life advice that likely has nothing to do with any of the curriculum and just comes from teachers or substitutes blabbing about their lives and experiences. Sadly however, this slim 10% isn't worth suffering through the other 90% with all of the added social pressures (dances, sex, party, social media, popularity, dating, bullying, etc.) 

I've wasted something like 14 or 15 previous years of my life in a shit hole surrounded by people the majority of whom have made me cynical, jaded, depressed, anxious, and borderline suicidal. Unlike the seemingly majority of people I have nothing positive to say about my experiences throughout elementary, middleschool and highschool. Considering the amount of fake people (adults included), bullying, rumors, lies, rejection, long and monotonous hours of sitting in total silence doing nothing but contemplating about how much I fucking hate my situation, and horribly awkward situations I've had to suffer through it's a miracle I'm still alive. I hope this school system gets ripped apart and fundamentally changed within the next few decades (hopefully sooner), or else I'm guessing this subreddit will double or triple."

I am a Psychology student and the dissertation is on the effect sleep disturbances on mental health (including anxiety, depression and suicidal behaviours).

There is a mass of evidence showing how taking part in studies on mental health is beneficial for those who are suffering (Gibson, Boden, Benson, &amp; Brand, 2014, Wong, Kwok, Michel, &amp; Wong, 2017), it has also been seen to greatly reduce suicidal ideation. I feel as those us on this subreddit will be able to give a good insight into this necessary research, please if you can, take part.

depression,g0mezdev,2020/1/28,"Post LSD trip: Depression replaced with creative melancholy As a yearly ritual, I¡¯ve taken a high dose of LSD, looking for the answers to questions about solitude, discipline, creativity and life in general.

A lot of things have happened since that trip, but one thing that has seemingly settled with me is that the extremes of clinical depression were replaced with an equally strong, but more constant feeling of melancholy. 

Anxiety has seemingly been skewed by the newly found ideas and revelations... When you can¡¯t help but cry every morning and every night, in uncontrollable fits, and then go on with your day, and it continues for a month, you notice it become a permanent and integrated part of your life. I see it as a great attempt to integrate my Jungian shadow, which seems closely correlated to depression, into the psyche, effectively becoming a character trait, with its ups and downs.

I¡¯m more mellow, more detached, focused, disciplined, active now. There were 2 choices I was to make after that trip: to end life, because why suffer?; or to continue the story, and continue searching for a reason?

Being a curious, lonely, antisocial kid from the get go, somehow curiosity became a value, and manifested strongly enough for me to actually say - I will not subject myself to the label ¡°clinically depressed¡± anymore. No more Sertraline, no more appointments, no more weakness in front of strangers. 

The tears remain, as well as the pain, and the same reasons for them too - ever since I was about 15 years old. Now I¡¯m almost 27, and perhaps it¡¯s time to act like my father never did - face responsibilities to prepare for the future, from a position of strength. Don¡¯t ignore the tears - embrace and express, because no artist has ever gone through life without experiencing an amplified version of pain and misery.

Currently we are all facing an unprecedented pandemic event, my thoughts are out for every life loving fighter, I'm confident we will beat this sooner rather than later. 

I'm a university student living outside of my uni alone in a private room and rarely go out and about only for classes and shopping, recently they have enforced a lockdown where I live and decided to go back( 2 days before the lockdown while the number of the cases were low) to my parents place throughout this lockdown to be with them and  take care of them if they needed groceries and so on. I've booked the bus (4 hour journey) which was half empty in the morning and I arrived and kept my distance, I've been here for 4 days now practicing social distancing and cleaning my hands regularly though I'm truly getting anxious for my parents as I'm afraid that I have the virus and asymptomatic, transmitting it to them in the process, I might seem crazy but every time someone is coughing and feeling tired I instantly go blank, I start to internally freak out and assuming the worst possible. I'm really getting extremely worried and its taking a toll on me mentally and physically, I honestly can't seem to get over it, I start regretting my decision to come back and should have stayed back, but kind of thought it was okay as alot of students were leaving too, chose the time where the bus was empty and avoided any close contacts in the process.

Reading the news as well doesn't help at all. I hope someone else can help me figure out how to stop over thinking and train my mind to think positive, even if the situation turns out to be negative.

My sleep is incredible impairs and my depression is spiraling.

I wake up every morning intending to go to work, but I simply cannot get myself out of bed, even if I am not in excruciating pain.  The depression and anxiety regarding my health situation, and need to wait weeks for a potential third surgery instills hopelessness/helplessness, as did the countless unproductive visits to urologists &amp; urological surgeons.

My work situation is not protected (will not get into that), and this is another source of anxiety.

Some days I can gather momentum and entirely plan/prep for tomorrow, but as soon as the alarms go off I begin having the internal fight with myself, and chose to e-mail my supervisor/boss to take off without pay (which is soon to become a potential hardship).

depression,Farqualpatine,2020/1/11,"Futile I was going to write a long post about how it is too late to pursue my aspirations in life, how I resent my parents for not getting me into the shit I wanted to be doing, or taking me to the goddamn dentist once in a while, how god owes me and many others a refund on our malformed bodies, or how I have inadvertently squandered all of my best opportunities-but I don't know if it matters to me any more.

 I'm thinking my detachment, my inability to feel hope or despair, is a system of coping with the damage of being raised, or born to desire something from life. Maybe happiness is just surviving and having occasional moments where one thinks ""this is nice"" for 80 years and then dying. 

So from now on I invite r/depression users to join me in identifying what they desire but can't have, even if it is something vital, and try to kill their hopes of attaining it so dead that they can't be driven to despair any more.

I'm not conventionally attractive, my social skills are passable at best, and i'm kind of a bummer to be around on account of the raging depression. I've learned to cope with this by devaluing the social rules that govern what makes a person appear positive and valuable (being the opposite of me) to the extent that i now view every experience as an illusion of neuron activity and hollistically devoid of meaning. This helps out sometimes, but i cant help slipping back into believing in these social norms as the end-all rules of life, under which i am a poor example of a human being. I don't know if i should keep trying to embrace the void until maybe i hit some kind of enlightenment or if i should wholeheartedly acknowledge how low i stand on the social totem pole and strive to draw from the system whatever comfort it has to offer me.

Discuss delayed post-exposure toxicity and stories. The damage to your mental and physical health can occur after you stop the drug. So many young men and women have had their mental health damaged, sometimes permanently, by taking accutane (or isotretinoin), even at a normal dose.

Although there's been a long-standing ""controversy"" about whether accutane actually causes mental health issues, there is irrefutable scientific proof that it does indeed change (sometimes permanently) key functions of the brain in multiple ways.

Keep in mind: the ""proof"" that accutane does NOT cause depression (which is, unfortunately, the current conviction of most dermatologists) is industry-funded, poorly conducted research.

If you developed mental health issues (depression, anxiety, suicidality, psychosis, brain fog/cognitive issues, memory issues, OCD, bipolar, schizophrenia, anhedonia, BPD etc), after taking accutane, there is very good reason to believe that accutane directly damaged your brain.

So: Introducing: [r/AccutaneDamage](https://www.reddit.com/r/AccutaneDamage/).

I had a 1.5 week long manic episode this past December with lots of triggers around (mainly family) and was constantly hyper on no sleep, starting a new research project (never finished once I slipped back into depression), anxiety off the charts (throwing up almost every day, multiple times a day whenever I had an emotional trigger), and my period ended up lasting 21 days. It began around the beginning of the episode and seemed to be ending at a normal time (I usually have a 10 day period) but bleeding ramped up again after the 10-day mark, which led me to look at my period tracker app and saw that over the last 6 months the time in between my periods have been really irregular.

I don't think my periods are linked to the manic/depressive cycles (because of the irregularities don't match with the mood cycles) but was wondering if anyone has had any experience with the cycles affecting periods. I'm pretty healthy besides that (no other health issues) and my hormone levels are all within range."

bipolar,sporglorg,2020/4/6,"A discussion about online/Zoom therapy Hello everyone

I'm a psychology researcher as well as someone who sees a therapist and has recently transitioned to remote therapy sessions because of COVID-19.

As I'm sure we all know, telemental health¡ª namely, live therapy sessions through technology/services like Zoom ¡ª has been on the rise in recent years, but is currently spiking because of COVID-19 and the need for everyone to stay indoors. 

Many therapists are adapting quickly and transitioning to remote sessions via apps like Zoom, including my own therapist. This is fantastic and is working for a lot of people, but, as I'm sure other patients and therapists on this sub are experiencing, many important parts of our usual therapy is getting left behind at the office.

For example, my therapist and I usually make use of an Oculus VR headset or actual physical objects/things for my exposure therapy. Now, we have to do things verbally or by sending links of images/videos. Additionally, my therapist usually gets a close-quarters view of my reaction and state of anxiety during our sessions, but this is significantly more difficult over video call (webcam quality, lag, etc.)

If you're a therapist, I'd really appreciate it if you could fill out my survey: [https://forms.gle/SkY9jkz7K8vBfkWs8](https://forms.gle/SkY9jkz7K8vBfkWs8). I'd love to understand this problem from your perspectives. This might turn into a research project at a later stage, but your answers from this survey won't be included there. My apologies if links aren't allowed here.

Otherwise, looking forward to discussing this with everyone and hearing your thoughts &amp; experiences so far :)."

bipolar,velvykat5731,2020/4/5,"Bipolar disorder is greatly overdiagnosed. I know it's underdiagnosed in the general population; that is, many people that might be living with bipolar disorder do not know it because they don't even suspect a psychiatric illness. But, among those who go seeking for a diagnosis due to emotional instability, impulsivity, etc., I believe bipolar disorder is overdiagnosed. I think many fit criteria for borderline personality disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, agitated unipolar depression, anxiety disorders... rather than bipolar. I suppose some specialists, when in doubt, prefer to diagnose someone as bipolar rather than borderline because of the stigma of borderline personality, but treatments differ. It's not only hurtful to the patients, because they do not receive adequate treatment, but to us because research starts to look heterogenous and statistics get messed up. 

I believe this is particularly true for bipolar disorder type II. Numbers I'm seeing everywhere are not reasonable. Four people with bipolar in a meeting of sixteen is not reasonable. The amount of bipolar people in the media industry, although it has always been high, is becoming ridiculous. 

I remember reading that changes were made from the DSM-IV to the DSM-5 to stop overdiagnosis by clarifying that episodes weren't only a subjective and emotional experience, but a physical one, with real changes as in appetite or sleep. I believe it wasn't enough.

Any thoughts on this?"

I'm an 29 year old male adult who was diagnosed with ADD late in life at the age of 25 years. For the last 4 years I've primarily taken Ritalin (30mg p/day) which has been an absolute game changer. 

For most of my life however, I've struggled with identify and self worth issues, the negative affects of having un-diagnosed ADD, but also regular mood shifts from feeling grounded, level headed, socially likable and intelligent to aggressive, angry, rude, socially unlikable and conflict orientated all in a matter of seconds. 

I first started taking anti-depressants and seeing a psychologist when I was about 20 years told to treat my panic attacks, anxiety, mood and self worth/identity issues. 

I've seen three difference Psychologists with my current one who I have been seeing for about 3 months working out reasonably well, although I put up pretty high walls so we have made some ground but I am resistant to letting people get too close, baby steps and all that. 

I tried a bunch of meds including venlafaxine (Effexor). fluoxetine (Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft). For me, these med did fuck all and in fact (again just my own experience and each person is obviously very different!). After swapping in and out new anti-depressants for about 3 years to try and find the right one for me, I finally gave up and decided to just get on with life and deal with these feelings in the best way I knew how, drinking, taking pills, porn, cocaine, smoking bongs, and any kind thing I could get my hands onto to  give myself a quick fix of dopamine, or feeling of happiness (I have a very additive personality and even when I'm mentally stable I still find myself seeking out these things at unnecessary times. 

I start my journey today on meds which hope to improve my mood disorder. I met with my new Psychiatrist yesterday and along with continuing my Ritalin medication, he has now prescribed me with Lithium (450mg p/day for the first week then, 900mg p/day there after) and Agomelatine (50mg p/day) for mild bi-polar disorder. 

It would be great to talk to people with similar experience to myself, particularly with ADD/Bi-polar or anyone that cant relate to what I am saying in any, shape or form.

bipolar,sealionpkr91,2020/3/4,"Qutting Olanzapine 2.5 MG (Zyprexa) after 2 years of use  

Hi all, long time lurker here and finally deciding to make a post to receive some additional input on something that has been troubling me for quite some time.

Two years ago, I had a psychotic episode (or 2) that had me in different hospitals for several weeks. The exact causation was not clear, but most likely it was drug-induced by THC oil (was also on Adderall for years, but do not think that was the cause).

Fast forward two years, I haven't had a single relapse or psychotic episode. The only drug I am currently taking is as prescribed by my doctor, namely, Olanzapine 2.5MG at night.

Ever since that psychotic episode, my complaint has been mental fatigue, not being able to think or express myself clearly, and not feeling any emotions. I wanted to see if the Olanzapine 2.5MG is causing this so I attempted to talk with my doctor about tapering off the drug to see if my symptoms would get better. My doc said he would not facilitate that as ""it might put you back in the hospital"". Basically, my doctor is telling me to either keep taking this drug indefinitely or fuck off and find another doctor willing to work with me.

So basically my question is - are my symptoms (mental fatigue, not thinking/expressing clearly, no emotions) a side effect of Olanzapine, a byproduct of Schiophrenia/Bipolar Disorder, or due to the possible permanent brain damage that THC oil had on me?

What would you do if your doctor wasn't willing to try new options with you?"

Im probably over-analyzing, but I often reflect on my past-times and how my newly diagnosed disorder pertains to past behavior or patterns of any kinds. (Mostly to just better understand how my mind might work)

I grew up as a 1980s baby where the likes of Nintendo and Arcade were at their peak influence to promote addiction. As a child I loved playing them and still do to this day.

But, things started acting funny in 6th and 8th grade where I had seizures after playing late night video games sessions, in the morning I would be in a grand maul seizure and in the hospital nearly dying.

But as I have gotten older and diagnosed, I still play, but I have always been attracted to very intense and emotional games that make me feel competitive and aggressive (the aggressive release is key for me to get out extra energy of the high end of bipolar disorder's never ending energy level). In my twenties I was addicted to super smash bros melee and competitive melee and I loved being social and hanging with friends traveling to tournaments.

Now as a father and less time for friends and things like that, I currently am addicted to Rocket League which offers quite the aggressive and intense gameplay.

I guess I just wanted to start a discussion of anyone who might also want to talk about how video games are either beneficial to our disorder or are possibly negative (obviously if you [play all day that isnt productive](https://bipolaronline.com/bipolar-and-playing-video-games-all-day/)) But I just wanted to analyze more how video games can either make our disorder worse or possibly better.

For me, its always a way to zone out and think and react quickly to perfect my reaction time to things, enjoy competition and appreciate the art and computer programming of video games.

That is why I started programming in the first place, was with video games.

So if there are any bipolar people who are also computer programmers, I want to get to know you too, so we can share strategies and love of games and code with each other to better understand how to get better at our craft of gaming master or code gods. Or at least we think we are gods when we are grandiose manic assholes who know everything!! LOL"

I recently had a manic episode lasting about 2 weeks that ended on a psychotic episode. The build-up to psychosis was fast went through things like ""understanding yoga"", ""learning techniques to influence interactions between people through Sound and movement"", "" learning to communicate with babies and animals through frequencies and vibrations"" and so on. 

One night, after a full day of meditation and yoga, trying to calm myself down as I tried in vain to sleep, I had an EXPERIENCE.

After the episode, it took time to distinguish what was real and what was not but I think I have been successful. Except I can't shake the feeling and idea that this moment, which was the least physical and which I know happened all in my brain was profoundly true and real.

I'm not talking about Messianic complexes (been there). I think I'm talking about what the mystics and phylosophers have talked about forever.

bipolar,HotShot345,2020/2/28,"Depression or Medication Side Effects I'm getting over a hypomanic episode that required Seroquel and an increased lithium dose (300 to 600) to resolve (told my doctor I didn't need an antipsychotic anymore, ended up back on one within 3 weeks). Past week and a half or so (around the same time my meds were adjusted), I've been experiencing low mood, decreased motivation, irritability, and passive suicidal ideation. I'm literally only getting out of bed to go to work, and even then, I'm failing at that (arriving late, working from home at the last minute, leaving early, or some combination). I haven't even had the desire to check or post on social media (other than Reddit) when I'm usually pretty active / interacting with friends.

I talked with my psychiatrist about all this today, and he suggested moving my lithium dose back down to 300 mg as that may improve the tiredness / lack of motivation I've been having. I refused because every time we lower my lithium, a hypomanic episode follows, and he agreed to keep it at 600. He suggested that it could be the Seroquel, but he didn't offer to take me off of it. It struck me that he didn't think it was the natural cycle of the bipolar that's causing this. Ultimately, we agreed (at my insistence) to up my Wellbutrin dosage to 300 (from 150) and see him again in a week.

I'm really new to actually being cognizant of my illness / actually wanting to treat it, and I was wondering how you guys differentiate between the side effects of drugs and the illness itself. I know if things change after a new medication is introduced, it's probably the medication, but I'm just not quite sure in this case because episode pattern has been (since September of last year): manic to mixed to normal to hypomanic. I feel like I'm ""due"" for a bout with depression if that makes sense."

Hello Folks

I am just curious if any of the members have had success in using homeopathy for psychiatric illness.

I have heard of many cases in India where patients were able to stop their medication or reduce it substantially using [homeopathy.](https://homeopathy.one/)

One of the successful psychiatrist is Dr.Mahesh Gandhi,who left allopathy and became homeopath as he felt the medications were drugging his patients.

bipolar,pennybeagle,2020/3/7,"Viewing bipolar on spectrum(s), rather than as a four-faceted categorical disorder. Long post including factors leading up to my diagnosis. I don¡¯t mean for it to be an attention-seeking post, I just hope y¡¯all can gather insight from it and So my psychiatrist has emphasized something really interesting to me that she uses in practice to employ a more personalized methodology to treat her bipolar patients. I thought would be helpful or beneficial to share.

I studied psychology academically for 8 years and it wasn¡¯t until I took a clinical course on abnormal child &amp; adolescent psych that it occurred to me I might have bipolar disorder. 

I am now 27 years old. This was about a year ago.

I remembered that during my early teenage years, I had a psychiatrist that put me on a mood stabilizer suspecting I had early-onset bipolar. It made me feel like a zombie and made me very sick, so my parents labeled that psychiatrist a quack, discontinued the medication, and went back to my old psychiatrist.

Prior to being diagnosed with bipolar, I had been diagnosed with PTSD, persistent major depression at age 10 w/ anxious features designator applied at age 24, ADHD, and an adjustment disorder (which I wasn¡¯t aware of until recently).

Of course, a lot of these symptoms of bipolar share overlapping features, which is why it¡¯s so difficult to correctly diagnose immediately unless someone is displaying extreme psychotic symptoms.

When I was first diagnosed, my psychiatrist looked at my chart and reviewed my psych/medical history and agreed with me. I¡¯d done my research and decided lamictal would be the best addition to my existing medication regimen. Again, she agreed.

As I¡¯ve returned for subsequent appointments, the diagnosis became slightly muddied by the fact that I¡¯d experienced a manic episode back in my teens and again with delusions when I was 25 (although that was subsequent to a miscarriage and discontinuation of vyvanse), which persisted for a good 6 months. 

When I asked why she did not amend my diagnosis to bipolar I, she explained that for patients who have existing psychiatric conditions, she prefers to treat bipolar on a spectrum in order to find the best method of treatment for each patient.

Even with medication and appropriate therapy, she says placement on the spectrum can change, but for the most part, my symptoms are most consistent with bipolar II, in that I most frequently experience and rapidly cycle between severe depression and hypomanic episodes. But since I¡¯ve only had two true manic episodes that I can recall, which were precipitated by extremely stressful circumstances, and a couple of episodes of dysphoric mania, she places me somewhere between bipolar I and II when evaluating me even though I am formally diagnosed with bipolar II. 

I think this makes a ton of sense. My bipolar has interfered with my life and function greatly, but I have never been hospitalized as a result. I¡¯ve never experienced severe psychosis or convinced myself I am Jesus. My medication regimen was easily implemented, I am extremely compliant with it, and it is extremely effective in maintaining my emotional stability. But, like I said, I have experienced mania and have not had my formal diagnosis very long, so the possibility exists that the severity of the bipolar can increase. So with that said, she views me as ¡°moderate¡± on the bipolar spectrum. 

Can anyone relate to how the spectrum would apply to them?

Do you think this provides a better method for diagnosis and treatment than the current categorical diagnosis under the DSM V? As far as  ICD 10 I think it can be modified to 5 categories for applicable billing and insurance purposes, as well as for academic research.

Thanks for reading my novel lol!!!! All comments welcome."

bipolar,malestar,2020/3/19,"C60 proven to be a neuroprotective agent; worked for me. Well, this doesn't fall into the category of ""alternative medicine"" since C60 has been peer reviewed.

However, it's not clear how a neuroprotective agent would help for depression or bipolar, so the following is my story and it may not work for others, however, I think that given the shit life most bipolar sufferers live on day by day, it's worth a try. It won't do you any harm.

2 years ago my brother told me about C60 and sent me some peer reviewed papers about it.

I started taking it right away and after just 1 month, after 14 years with severe bipolar symptoms, I started to feel way better. Then the second month I had absolutely no symptoms at all but I was still on meds. The third month I told my psychiatrist about this and he started lowering my meds. By the fifth month I was without meds completely (until this day) and I was experiencing no symptoms at all. In fact I felt better than normal and able to make decisions and thinking more clearly, feeling more intelligent and having no regret or doubt and many other physical improvements such as enhanced recovery from hangovers (in fact no hangovers), fast recovery from exercise at the gym and some other weird stuff like my eyesight improving, higher sexual drive, never feeling tired and sleeping all the way 'til morning. I also never got sick of \*anything\* to this date, and I've done some risky stuff several times like being with my then-girlfriend when she had the flu and tonsillitis.

C60 acts, among other things, as a scavenger, meaning that it penetrates cells, grabs toxins and then takes them out and they're urinated or defecated. It's also anti bacterial and anti viral and it's used for Cancer.

bipolar,Gday613,2020/1/14,"Depakote curbing hypomania into a mixed episode? Has anyone experienced this? 

I feel like with depakote I have depressed periods that it doesn't really help with, periods where I'm functional, and then periods where it honestly feels kind of like what my S.O has described with their BPD. One minute I'm super excited about a project, and then later that day I'll be despondent, then excited, then somebody will say something and it'll make me depressed again, etc.

The only time I've really felt a euphoric rush is when my psychiatrist raised my dosage without properly communicating to Walgreens and I missed out on a weekend of doses.  It was honestly nice walking around feeling like James Bond, until the racing thoughts and paranoia set in.

It's actually made it kind of hard to get a proper diagnosis, because usually when I'm feeling in that heightened state, it's not euphoric, and so despite Bipolar being on my chart and having been on mood stabilizers for a year, the label is still somewhat of a question mark.

So I've recently been diagnosed as bipolar, and I don't really have much information to go on. I spoke to my psychiatrist about ""a voice that's not mine"" that I keep having (not an auditory hallucination) just feels like someone else is commenting on what I should do, (usually involving some form of self-harm or intrusive thoughts). 

So my psychiatrist originally put me on rexulti, which was working to an extent, and the voice came back less, but when it was there, it has come back with a vengeance. In the span of 20 minutes one night in particular, it told me several different ways I should essentially kill myself. After that episode, I've now been switched to resperidone and upped my wellbutrin. Fourth day on it now, and I genuinely feel like I'm on an up, but it also makes me wonder, am I actually bipolar, or am I losing my mind.
I'm also a bit nervous because my psychiatrist said if this course of treatment doesn't work with the intrusive thoughts, that the hospital may be the best course of treatment for now, which with the whole covid thing, I would really like to avoid going to ""ground zero"".

bipolar,yubnubnub,2020/2/7,"Lithium toxicity that caused a rare kidney disorder called Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus Has anyone else experienced this happen to them? This will be somewhat long, I apologize.

I started Lithium 1x a day 300mg back in November 2019. Got my levels checked from bloodwork, levels came back low at 0.2 mmol/L, so my doctor upped the dosage to 2x a day 300mg. Levels were checked again in December 2019, were in the therapeutic range at 0.7 mmol/L. The ¡°therapeutic¡± range are between 0.6 to 1.2 for clarification.

At this point, my moods were perfectly fine and stable, but I noticed some side effects, like being thirsty constantly and urinating a lot. 

January 15 2020 comes, and I get my levels checked again, they are back down in the low range at 0.4, so they get increased to 3x a day 300mg each. 

I start to notice after I start the new dosage a week later that my coordination is off, I start to become very confused, I¡¯m extremely thirsty and peeing constantly, and after the 2nd dosage I take, I notice my pinks are very pink, like I¡¯m wearing blush. 

On Jan 27, I call my doctor and tell them my symptoms, and she tells me she doesn¡¯t know what¡¯s wrong with me and that I should go to the urgent care. I suggest that I go to the ER, since if there is something actually wrong with me, they¡¯d send me to the ER anyways.

I go to the ER, tell them I think I possibly have Lithium Toxicity, and I get a room right away. They take my blood and urine, and I notice my urine is colorless. They come back with my blood results, and they say my levels are at 0.2, so they are at the same range when I was taking 1x a day, even though I¡¯m taking 900mg total.

They end up admitting me, I see a Neurologist because of the confusion and poor coordination, I see a Nephrologist due to possible damage of my kidneys from the Lithium, and a Psychiatrist. 

They end up finding out from my urine test that I had a adverse reaction to taking Lithium that cause toxicity due to drug induced, not level induced, and caused me to develop Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus, 

The exact definition of Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus is an ¡°inability to concentrate urine due to impaired renal tubule response to vasopressin (ADH), which leads to excretion of large amounts of dilute urine. It can be inherited or occur secondary to conditions that impair renal concentrating ability.¡±

This condition, as told by my kidney doctor, only happens in 10-15% of patients that have been taking Lithium for 15 years, and I have only been taking it for 3 months, which surprised them. 

I¡¯m completely off Lithium, only taking Lamictal 25mg 1x a day, and I feel perfectly fine! ??"

Not only do I have an aunt who was diagnosed as bipolar a few years back, but in college, I had several periods of what I believe were hypomania, if not full blown mania, as well as four episodes of severe self harm/near suicide attempts. The periods of possible hypomania were characterized by prolonged insomnia, impulsive/risky decisions (which almost led to legal consequences...twice), dissociation, unchecked impulsive spending, and periods of frantic activity. It felt like my mind was racing and my heart was going ten times faster than normal, and I had to get everything done before the world imploded. I felt so in control but at the same time I was watching myself from somewhere else and none of it was actually true. My decisions made so much sense but when I looked back on them weeks later it felt like looking at the decisions of a stranger.

bipolar,mjmiller3416,2020/4/15,"Potential issues with mood stabilizer Hey everyone! 

Brief recap for some context. I'm 29, over the years I've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, depression, bipolar II, PTSD, and ADHD (specifically in that order, going back about 5 years). I've been on numerous medications, too long to count. My current medications are: Effexor for anxiety and depression, Lamotrigine for bipolar, Prazosin for PTSD, Trazodone for sleep issues and Adderall for ADHD. 

My question for the community is, could my mood stabilizer be negatively impacting the potency of my other medications, specifically my ADHD medicine? I have all the symptoms of someone with ADHD, I've seen multiple Psychiatrists over the years and they all agree. Despite the 4 different ADHD medications I've tried, I feel no different. No negative effects, but nothing positive either. I'm currently on 30mg of Adderall twice a day and I see zero difference when taking it, none, whatsoever. 

I've been taking Effexor for about 3 years, Lamotrigine, Trazodone and Prazosin for about 18 months, and I've tried four different ADHD medications over the last 3 months. The problem is, the only relief from any of my symptoms, seems to be the depression. I still have terrible anxiety which cripples so many aspects of my life. I still have bouts of mood swings, typically going from feeling 'okay' to angry without any time to process how I'm feeling. Every night I'm having awful nightmares and waking up at least 4-5 times throughout the night. And my concentration is awful, I'm constantly forgetting things, can't focus or multitask and have trouble listening to and follow directions especially at work. 

I guess my theory is because my mood stabilizer is meant, by definition, to stabilize me, that it's possibly causing my other medications to be less effective. Has anyone else experienced any issues similar to these or am I a lone wolf in all this? 

Sorry for the ramble, thanks for reading."
bipolar,my-name-is-tom2,2020/4/8,"I have Bipolar Type II disorder ¡ª and I just got accepted into a Physics PhD program! I started experiencing symptoms for Bipolar II disorder in the months leading up to my 21st birthday. Months of depression, during which all I wanted to do was sleep or lie in bed watching tv - I didn¡¯t even want to eat. I was struggling to do simple things like pick out clothes for the day or buy things at the grocery store; it was a total loss of self-confidence, and I didn¡¯t think I would ever be able to accomplish anything. Things got dark. 

My first hypomanic episode immediately followed the first serious depressive episode. During this, I came up with extravagant philosophies for life, dreamed up how I was going to become super-successful, and truly believed I had superpowers. I felt, really I knew, that I was the smartest and most capable person in the room at any given time, and nothing could bring me down. As this continued, I got into big fights with my family, made some reckless decisions, and became quite unaware of myself.

The lack of stabilization in my mood was having a negative effect on my classes. I ended up having a pretty significant drop in my GPA with the onset of the symptoms. I started seeing a therapist, which helped, but I was still struggling. 

For years, I dreamed of pursuing a PhD in physics, and my bipolar II disorder was very close on several occasions to causing me to give up the dream entirely. I wasn¡¯t able to get my life together in time to apply to PhD programs during my senior year of undergrad, or even during the first year after college. I didn¡¯t think I would be able to manage the stress of a doctoral program while also managing my symptoms. 

Finally, I started taking medication (Lamictal) in conjunction with talk therapy. Since then, I¡¯ve been doing a lot better at managing my symptoms, and my mood has been much more stable. 

This past December/January, I applied to programs, and was accepted to a great one that I¡¯m super excited about! (Leaving out the name of the university because PhD programs are small.) 

I know it¡¯s going to be hard, but I feel like this is what I¡¯ve spent the last several years really working towards, and I feel proud of myself for overcoming the challenges associated with my bipolar II disorder! 

TL;DR Bipolar II disorder almost stopped me from pursuing my dream of getting a PhD in physics, but I¡¯ve been learning how to better manage my symptoms, and am starting a doctoral program this fall ¡ª psychotherapy and medication help!"
bipolar,popsjohnson,2020/4/5,"Post-Mania Embarrassment Awhile ago, I went through that silly thing where taking lithium decreased my symptoms so I thought, oh, I must be misdiagnosed, I don't have bipolar symptoms.

Then I recently went through a depressive episode which bounced back with the start of an increasingly manic episode. During this episode I got a new job, working around new people, then I started to notice I was getting increasingly energetic, sleeping less so taking more and more sleeping pills, thinking WAY too highly of myself and becoming paranoid. Then I got put back on lithium in what I would say was 'just in time' as the rational voice was getting quieter and quieter.

At this new job when I was manic, I was loud, obnoxious, taking on extra this and extra that, and that was how these new people met me.

But I'm not that person. Now, after three weeks I'm getting calmer and calmer, but many literally think I'm just a complete, stupid, immature idiot and some others miss that 'me' because I made them laugh a lot, often at my own expense.

Now it's getting harder to face them every day, either in embarrassment, or with anger when they imply I'm stupid or immature.

Obviously I have to stick with it, and will, but what should I do in the meantime? What do I tell myself in those moments? I try to be pretty open about my issues, but how do I explain in ways neurotypical laymen would understand?"
bipolar,MrsHylander,2020/2/9,"Am I being guilted or am I just too sensitive? My sister wrote this to me earlier today. I had started setting more boundaries with my family and taking a step back from them. I had expressed to my sister and honestly my whole family that I was going to need more space over the next few months while I start some intensive therapy. 

I am so hurt by this and feel as if she was guilting me for having bipolar. I¡¯d love your opinions on this and if maybe I am taking it too personal? 


¡°One thing I would say, though, as someone who had a serious relationship with a bipolar guy going through therapy and trying to get a handle on himself &amp; his bipolar is that it was really hard for me to deal with as a partner.  He was so focused on understanding and managing his own feelings and thinking about how things affected him that I often felt he had no empathy for other people¡¯s feelings (including mine) and zero interest in, concern for, or understanding of how his behavior impacted the people around him.  

Friends I¡¯ve talked with who have bipolar family members have said really similar things.  I felt he was selfish or self-involved at times and, therefore, utterly unsuitable for having relationships with anyone because of his laser focus inward, and friends with bipolar parents or siblings have said the same.  ¡°My mom can¡¯t think about anyone but herself.  She can¡¯t understand any feeling but her own.¡±  That kind of thing.

I do understand that it can be an important step, and not just for people who have bipolar but for all of us looking to feel better about our lives and relationships.  You need to understand what impact other people have on you so that you can better manage your responses to them and make healthy decisions about whether to continue relationships, but if you go too far into yourself, it may be other people deciding you aren¡¯t good for them because you don¡¯t express concern or empathy and don¡¯t come across as interested in how your behavior impacts them, only on how they impact you.

This is a general statement and not about you except as something to keep in mind.  It¡¯s also nice when you communicate to people that you are taking time and stepping back for a bit so that they don¡¯t worry or feel hurt.¡±"
bipolar,darkat4pm,2020/1/22,"Prozac (Fluoxetine) - Short Term Monotherapy (SAD element) **TLDR:** started having long, severe episodes at 16, correctly diagnosed at 28. Medication resistant - SSRIs, SNRIs, various mood stabilisers and atypical antipsychotics. Medication-free with medical approval between 30 - 34, other than propranolol sporadically for the past year. Main factors affecting episodes - period cycles (PCOS), seasonal changes and situational stress. Complex migraines. No auditory or visual hallucinations for several years - previously mild. No history of self-harm or suicide attempts.

My GP suggested monotherapy with fluoxetine for a moderate depressive episode which has dragged on since October. No intention of self harm or suicide etc, so it's just a persistent low mood which I would normally ignore. However, as it was triggered by a rotating shift pattern and very drawn out, stressful event (now resolved) and my depressive episodes typically last until March, I agreed to try it short term. Historically SSRIs have given me rapid cycling, though fluoxetine was the exception and just generally numbed my mood (still depressed but not dwelling) and made me more sociable. 

I normally keep a daily, paper-based mood journal and track moods affected by period cycle on Clue. While I am concerned that it might trigger a mixed or manic episode, I think I have enough insight that I would stop taking it and report symptoms early on. Additionally I study therapy and any fast or disorganised speech etc. is fed back to me as part of training. 

Mostly I'm taking it for general motivation since I've become very pessimistic and cynical over the past few months - for real reasons which I can fully justify. However, it's not really helping me move forward and I'm turning down various good opportunities as a result. 

I had the first pill yesterday (combined with propranolol and painkillers for a migraine earlier in the day) and so far feel fine."
bipolar,suicideenby,2020/3/15,"Odd/unexpected response from new psych about side effects, DAE taking trileptal... CW: former rec drug use, hospitalization, lemme know if anything else should or shouldn't be here
TLDR: calm my anxious mind DAE taking oxcarbazebine have mild physical discomfort or pain when you miss a dose?


This may be difficult for me to accurately paint a complete picture of, and sorry for bringing this all up in the middle of the system breakdown, but the more I think about this weird interaction with my new, very random clinic psychiatrist, the more disturbed I get. It's nothing big, just gives me that heebiejeebies ""lunatics running the asylum"" feeling I would get as a kid when I could tell the adults weren't doing what they were supposed to/didn't know what they were doing and I realize now this is exactly the neglect that caused another disorder... Anyway! Backstory because I'm still kind of new to effectively navigating mental health pros and not great communicating with ANY Dr because: autism and I just keep replaying this one in my brain.  

Former MDMA use is a potential difference here, but keep in mind I've also been getting the wrong depression meds Rxed on and off for 1mo or more at a time for about 15 years as my hypomania can be productive (and head injuries or something bring my baseline affect to grumpy/sad. think George Carlin or Aubrey Plaza generally. I'm *not* a bubbly person.) so I only ever complained about the depression. Stigma prevented me from accepting friends' armchair bipolar diagnoses over the years, and so many of the the wrong meds and bad fit therapists made me very distrustful of mental health help, so it wasn't until I was hospitalized at 38 after my symptoms once again worsened after a simple outpatient surgery (again would have been great for everyone to have understood this before the surgery) and an emergency psych Dr magically, just by looking at my fkn cheekbones somehow (it's crazy triggering to think about but trust me dude looked at my face gestured to his own cheeks and told me he'd seen this bipolar before), put me on a med that basically felt like nothing (which had never happened) but also stopped my random crying spells, trileptal or oxcarbazepine, but at the hospital they gave me way too much and after with my regular psych at that time who was amazing at listening, we worked out that because I'm just sensitive to most medications I really only need half of the lowest dose to see improvement. Now the other reason it helps me to maintain the lowest effective dose instead of stepping up, is that I forget or miss a dose often because of sleep or adhd issues that I also struggle with. So if I miss a dose it's much much better for me to miss a low dose than a much larger one. It's probably not ideal long term but with my ability to self care it's the best I can do for myself. 


Now I explained that last bit to the new doc and that if I miss it feels really bad like physically, but if I am doing well at taking it then I have to choose to miss one somewhere every few weeks to ""tolerance break"" essentially and make the medication more effective again. This almost never happens and I don't ever stop taking it because I feel better or think I don't need it as mania often does, and I dislike missing doses because I like not crying every day and it's physically uncomfortable on top of the low.  My nerves or something ache in my hands. 
Now when he asked me ""what does it feel like?"" after I said I didn't like how it felt, my brain stuttered because it's initial response was ""exactly like coming down off ecstacy, guy"" but first, I have no idea what this Dr thinks of those users and I'm just not inclined to reveal my former recreational drug use on the first visit, it's never worked out for me and hasn't hurt me to withhold until I know their harm reduction stance. 
Because my brain had to fluster there a second to try to explain, it didn't initially strike me as odd that this dude had never heard of an uncomfortable withdrawal side effect I have from such a widely distributed med. 


Now it's bugging me. 


DAE have former MDMA/e/molly experience and/or take this medication and know what I'm talking about with the like achey nerves? Did I just fry my CNS out somehow by hella overdosing my autistic system with those early aughts club drugs? (This one is basically rhetorical) This could prob be crossposted to askdrugnerds, but the oxcarb withdrawal experience is really the bit I want to sus out is normal. Am I alone or does anyone else notice that it makes like your extremeties achey when you've missed a dose? 

Basically I'm just trying to figure out if my brain is extra weird, I'm the poor communicator here as usual, or if this guy dispensing my meds now is the total dingus he seemed like."

About 6-8 weeks ago I was severely depressed and suicidal. After 2-3 or so very low weeks the depression and suicidality seemed to be gradually improving, but my irritability and agitation remained the same or even got a bit worse.

I was prescribed Prozac two weeks ago and the upward trend seemed to continue initially, but then the agitation/discomfort/irritability started getting much worse. Beginning a few days ago it got to the point where I was filled with this uncomfortable, aggressive, buzzing energy and felt like I was going to scream or explode yet wanted to cry at the same time.

Yesterday and today I've been extremely talkative, everything is funny, my brain is in overdrive, I have all this energy and want to do ALL THE THINGS, and generally feel pretty good.

bipolar,Double-your-dating,2020/2/28,"Killing Ghosts | How To Not Get Ghosted Online (Article)  

Modern dating apps can be a cesspool for emotionally unavailable millennials with commitment issues. Not commitment issues in terms of marriage or a home mortgage, no-no. Commitment issues like continuing a conversation when it requires more than 8 brain cells to develop an appropriate response. Or commitment issues like making plans for Friday with someone on Tinder but then your friends want to hang out so, whatever, it¡¯s just some Bumble girl, just never talk to her again.

This leads to an exhausting string of matches-that-never-turned-into-dates, also known as ¡°ghosts¡±. You might also be familiar with the ever-popular ¡°orbiting¡± which occurs when someone stops talking to you before or after a first date but continues stalking your social media and watching all your stories.

It¡¯s a strange time we live in, undoubtedly, with problems like these stopping great relationships from becoming real in their tracks. Not only having a negative impact on us and our potential love lives, but it¡¯s making online dating sites a drain of time and energy, instead of using them for what they were intended¡­going on dates with great people you would have never had a chance to meet otherwise.

I¡¯m as guilty as the next guy of the casual ¡°ghosting¡± but I¡¯ve committed to stop wasting people¡¯s time and actually meet up with as many of my matches as possible. You, too can help out and put an end to ghosting. If you¡¯re worried someone might ghost you, consider using the[ following](https://kismetacademy.tv/) opener:

¡°So, hey, I know this might be a bit forward, but do you wanna add each other on Snapchat and then never talk again?¡± ??

Or¡­

¡°So what do you think the chances are this conversation leads to a brief text exchange then we make plans to meet, follow each other on Snapchat and then never talk again?¡±

The other person will surely reply with something along the lines of ¡°I¡¯m not like that,¡± or ¡°Not me!¡±

Essentially calling out the elephant in the room will cause the person on the other end to snap out of the regular routine and take you seriously. This will increase the chance you don¡¯t get ¡°ghosted¡± by 90%, provided you don¡¯t screw up in a major way by making one of these crucial online dating attraction killers I talk about here.

Also, millennials, I know having hundreds of people want to match with you on a dating app is a real ego trip, but don¡¯t match with someone if you don¡¯t intend on meeting them. If we all do our part and make a real effort to meet up with our matches, we will all benefit from experiencing many more romantic relationships, and if nothing else, making cool friends. Even if that guy or gal you meet doesn¡¯t end up being ¡°the one¡±, maybe their best friend will be ??.

I've talked to three other professionals in this practice that have confirmed that I have bipolar i. He is very reluctant to agree because I was not arrested or hospitalized leading up to this diagnosis (as student of abnormal psychology, that just seems wrong, am I crazy??). Either way he's trying me on meds that he would prescribe for mild cylcothymia while his colleagues have whole heartedly agreed that I am living with bipolar. He says he will not diagnose me with bipolar until he has met me in person multiple times (even though that would only happen once a month once quarantine is eventually lifted and by then I'll have probably just adjusted to the mild medication he's prescribed me).

This has been pretty stressful. I've been trying to work on opening up to people in my life and slowly letting people close to me know what's going on. I just feel so restless and awful because I'm trying to work through this diagnosis and figuring out meds and doctors and there's so much on my mind that I want to talk about with literally anyone. Even though my therapist knows I'm dealing with bipolar she keeps talking to me about substance abuse issues which are relevant but are also the least of my worries since I don't have addiction problems in the slightest. I've just been getting more and more on edge because she's just been blowing over any bipolar symptomatic stuff that I bring up. I get more and more frustrated with each appointment. 

The practice normally has group sessions but those have ceased for the time being since they don't have the logistics down for video or group sessions. I guess I'm happy that I'm finally getting treatment but I'm angry that I put my life on hold to do it and that it's just going so badly. I feel like if I could talk to someone face to face, not even in person, I would be able to get across so much better and get what I want to get out of this."

So naturally I had intense highs and lows including a few days where I had feelings of grandeur and didn¡¯t feel the need to sleep. Ever since I stopped abusing stimulants I haven¡¯t had an episode resembling hypomania for longer than a few hours. I talked to my psychiatrist about this and he said that it only takes one episode of hypomania to diagnose bipolar. (This doctor also seems like he is not really interested in my situation almost indifferent or apathetic). Side note I¡¯ve been taking clonazepam and Lamotrigine for the past 5 years. This has reduced panic attacks and the sensation that I¡¯m losing my mind. Still feel long episodes of intense depression and suicidal ideation. 

Should I trust my psychiatrist and continue believing I have bipolar 2 or should I start looking at alternative causes for my depression and anxiety (see another psychiatrist). Other side note: my therapist does not believe I¡¯m bipolar.

Now, statistically speaking, that's not that bad. BUT, I really am struggling with medications right now, and have been for the past 3 years. Before that, I was labeled with GAD and Clincal depression. Than, I had my first hospitalization after dropping $8000 in a month on drugs and shopping. (Had never really had much interest in drugs besides marijuana before my first classified manic episode.) 

Since then, I have tried a variety of drug cocktails, with mostly antipsychotics and SSRI's, plus some anticonvulsants on occasion. I just can't handle it anymore. I really feel like I'd be better off forgoing further treatment, and living off-grid in the woods somewhere, where I can't cause destruction to others anymore.

I am medicated now, but am wondering what recurring bouts of psychosis and mania look like. It was in November - January 2018 that the episode occurred, and so far all I have felt since is depression.

Once you go manic or psychotic again after the first time, are you more aware that things are going wrong? Or does the brain just flip a switch and suddenly the psychotic thinking makes sense again?"

Since then I have been taking 325mg of lamictal everyday an have never stopped for more than a few days because of running out. I have been in a mostly depressive state and had no extreme manic episodes since starting these. I can't handle it anymore and need to feel good again. 

After reading quite a bit of literature it seems to be widely accepted that people who have only experienced 1 manic episode may be able to stop taking medication in as little as 6 months, again I've been taking this dosage for about 6 years.  I believe that I should be able to manage symptoms by continuing to see my counselor, using CBT and mindfulness strategies along with daily excercise. I should add I was about 34 years old before being diagnosed so I was able to manage without even knowing that some of my feelings and behaviors were ""abnormal"". 

My question is how do I express this to my psychiatrist? Due to the way my prescription is I can't taper down without her changing the dosage. Also, I'm diagnosed ADD and need her to continue prescribing me my Adderall and fear she may not continue this script if I choose to go of the lamictal. Without the adderall, focusing is extremely difficult and I believe I won't be able to do my job.

bipolar,wellersnow,2020/2/26,"Fast cycling, Sertraline to Depakote Hi all,

Not really sure what I'm looking to get out of posting this - I'm going to do it anyway as I need to get some things written down and off my chest and hope to get some views on how to proceed.

Things have been very rocky the last month and I'm concerned with the direction things are going as it seems to be going from worse to worse.

I was diagnosed with Bipolar 4 years ago after being placed on Sertraline (Zoloft). I was originally prescribed it for OCD symptoms and trauma from a traumatic experience from the past. Within 1 week on 50mg, I wasn't sleeping, had plenty of plans and ideas and thought I was going to be a millionaire in a few weeks. Each night I was only sleeping for a few hours whilst still going to work the next day. I went back to the doctors and this is when I got the diagnosis of Bipolar and was placed on 300mg instant release Seroquel. Docs still wanted me to stay on sertraline at only 50mg.

Over the next few years, during my hypomanic episodes, I taught myself to write computer code to create a new web-based business automation software. I thought this was going to be huge and worth millions and that I could sell this to run away from where I currently live due to paranoia about people coming to kill me. Seroquel was eventually raised to 600mg IR at night where I stayed for a good while.

Seroquel caused 4 stone weight gain and really bad bruxism which started to wear my teeth down a lot. It also felt very un-natural when I took it and made me feel like my body was shutting down. I made a bad (good?) decision and stopped this 1 year ago without doctors guidance. I didn't involve the doctors as felt discouraged by the whole help process from the doctors, leaving me on just Sertraline. Since stopping the Seroquel, I was cycling between hypomania and depression each 1-3 months. During the hypomanic episodes, I would be working on learning more about computer programming and obsessively building my software with the plan of making millions and running away. During depressive phases I smoked loads of cannabis and did no work on my software (thought it was a pile of rubbish during these phases) and my performance at work would drop massively.

I work as an IT engineer and had new management come in to become my new leader. This caused me real distress as I felt that I had been pushed back into a lower role, where I felt I am more capable of doing higher level work and I've been constantly trying to get my work to use this new platform I've created. The amount of times I've handed in my notice and revoked it over the last 4 years is crazy. My new manager is essential doing what I was doing before he came into the business and this caused a real ego hit for myself, which I feel I hold a grudge there due to this.

About 1 month ago, my 6 year relationship fully broke down due to bad things I had done and constant arguing. I fully accept responsibility for this happening and came clean with what I had done and we came to an agreement that it would be best to break up.

I had a ""crisis"" after this and got in touch with the local mental health teams. They've taken me off the Sertraline and put me on Depakote twice a day at 250mg. All was going well until today...

I've been sleeping 23:00-07:00, going to the gym each morning and eating much better. Today I noticed my mood has started going really high with a very inflated sense of self, which turned into paranoia believing people were removing important sent items from my email box and eventually called out my manager and his manager (the director) in front of the whole office, asking them to let me leave the job right away and called them ""unprofessional"". As soon as I have what I call a ""blow out"" where I get angry and kick off, depression hits right away, until the hypomania takes effect again within a few days.

I don't want to leave this company as it's like a family, but I feel my condition makes it so hard for the people around me and when I'm like this I just want to be a hermit. I've explained my situation to them fully, and they are very understanding and do all they can to make me stay. It's just embarrassing though and I feel as thought I should resign.

The only good thing to come from these last 4 years is the web-based business automation platform I've built during hypomanic phases has ended up as a really beneficial piece of software, and I am giving a demo to the directors of the company in a few weeks, with the plan of it being used extensively through the business. This is my absolute dream coming true, being able to use my own creation in a company I love, but it feels very bittersweet due to the underlying issues going on.

My problems are though:

\- I'm sick of the embarrassment caused during my flip outs in the middle of the office. It's also really not fair on the people who have to take the brunt. Every-time this happens, I feel awful afterwards and apologise profusely right away to the people who have taken the brunt. I feel although work are super-supportive and want me to stay, I should leave the company due to a. how I make other people feel and b. ruined reputation. Any thoughts or people dealing with similar workplace issues?

\- I'm concerned of the hypomania I felt today. Last few days I've been sleeping better than I have in ages, eating better and going to the gym each morning since being on the Depakote. Do you ever find when you start to get healthier and get that feel good feeling, that it can induce a manic episode? I feel so strange this evening it's crazy, not sure if this is also due to Sertraline withdrawal.

\- Psych wants to add another anti-psychotic into the mix and continue upping the dose of Depakote. I'm okay with Depakote being upped, but due to the bad experience with anti-psychotics in the past, I'm scared about going on this again. Does anyone have any experience with a mixture of an anti-convulsant and anti-psychotic together?

Sorry for the long rant and I'm not even sure it all makes sense, just need people to talk to who have similar experiences as I find people without the disorder find it really hard to relate to it, and therefore it's hard to discuss it with anyone. And also feeling so damn low after the ""blow out"" today....

Nothing really makes sense anymore!?!"

bipolar,brain_curious,2020/1/12,"Who has an integrative pDoc? tl;dr - anyone here worked with an integrative psychiatrist? Any tips, advice, recommendations, , what to look for etc? 

So, I'm preparing for my next taper down on lamotrigene. Probably from 150mg to 137.5mg; a few months ago I went from 200 to 150 and that was too much. Couple weeks of not being able to do much focused work, and some withdrawal effects, but it settled out eventually. I'm now aiming for probably 5-10% dose reductions at a time. 

I have a good functional medicine MD, who no longer prescribes psych meds for me after he recommended a 2-day taper off Abilify that sent me back to mania. I really like the guy, but don't know if I like him as my doctor, and definitely not for the bipolar side. A little over a year ago I found a nurse psychiatrist to prescribes meds. She's helped me taper off Abilify (6 months) and the last lamotrigene taper, but for the most part she just goes along with what I plan, and does not have a good idea about what it takes to taper, or about supplements, or other integrative methods. But, she's open minded and supportive of a taper, and not all script-writers are.

I recently saw a new therapist / coach, who isn't a MD but hires &amp; trains integrative MD pDocs in other businesses he owns. He also has a bipolar diagnosis, and I'm excited about taking advice from someone coming from a similar position, who has been successful in helping others. He recommended I see an integrative pDoc, which I've been thinking about for a long time. I haven't actually had a real psychiatrist since my last one retired in 2012. Been sort of piecing it together with different providers, and lots of self-experimentation, but might be nice to take advice from people who really know this stuff. 

I have a 15 min meet and greet with one of his psychiatrists this coming week. I also met last Friday with a neurofeedback / neurostim provider (who is also a therapist, but only does neuro stuff these days), and have a meeting with an integrative neurotherapist (neurofeedback included) on Thursday. I don't feel like I NEED to change my care up in order to be ok or to continue tapering, but I'm hoping to find the most optimal advice. 

Any thoughts or feedback? Thanks y'all!"
bipolar,ImpartialExhaustion,2020/1/7,"I am experiencing a mixed episode and I'm terrified and sad. For a couple weeks, I've felt really off, but I don't know why. Typically for the past 10 years, I fall into a depression around December that gets to be the worst in January and tapers as the winter ends. For the past few years I've experienced hypomania or mania at least once a year. In June 2017 I was hospitalized for mania. In September 2018 I had a brief 2 week manic episode including delusions. In May of last year, I experienced mania, then suicidal depression leading to hospitalization, then mania directly after, due to medication changes in quick succession.

I am exhibiting signs of hypomania and depression now. For hypomania, I am not sleeping at night but napping in the day, becoming very obsessive with reading old documents I've written, questionable spending habits despite having little money to spend, my vision seems swimmy and lights are irritating me, my teeth have been chattering, and I'm starting to revisit reading on topics that are traumatizing to me.

For depression, I'm eating poorly, stopped exercising or enjoying or pursuing hobbies, not showering often, too distracted to finish important tasks, incredibly moody, and talking to people feels like I'm reciting a script, so I think there's some depersonalization going on.

I'm on meds (weaning off Klonopin from docs orders, Buspar to replace Klonopin, Lithium, and Zoloft) but it feels like nothing's working. 

I should note that things in my personal life aren't well. My uncle died of brain cancer in October, I was let go from my job around Halloween and haven't found a new one, my relationship is rocky, we put our cat to sleep today, and I have been feeling completely directionless and unable to find motivation to decide on or pursue anything conducive to any kind of stable future.

My plan is to see a psychiatrist this week if possible. I'm just fucking scared to death. I don't want this to get worse and I'm just starting to get job interviews. I feel lost, scared, unsupported because I don't know what I need so I don't know how anybody can help, and like a total failure. I've been ruminating lately about deaths of loved ones throughout my past, and it is suffocating me. I look like hell and I feel even worse. I don't know what life is going to be like if this just keeps fucking happening despite all the med changes, inpatient, outpatient, and therapists. I don't really know how to go on anymore.

Thanks for reading."
bipolar,jameye11,2020/2/19,"I'm considering stopping my meds, but hear me out first... I was diagnosed with bipolar a few months ago, and I've been on medication since. However, my last visit (6 weeks ago) the psychiatrist told me it's only a mild form of bipolar (I suppose after seeing them often enough they can boil it down to that). 

Now here's where it gets a bit tricky. I was born without a thyroid. Congenital hypothyroidism. I've been on medication for that since I was 2 days old. This past month after doing some research I've found that my bipolar symptoms (mania, anxiety, fatigue, memory loss, etc) are most likely from my thyroid issues. 

My question to you guys is, should I still consider stopping medication and see if talk therapy alone helps? Obviously no one wants to take medication if they don't have to, and I know a lot of people with bipolar have told their horror stories here about what happens when they stop taking their meds, but I really wasn't a huge threat to myself or others before I started on medication. It was more of a ""somethings wrong and I need to do something about it"" situation, and I didn't start doing talk therapy until after I started medication."

So I've been taking Lexapro and Seroquel for a handful of months now. I've had Depression/Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder for years, but just recently got onto those medications through my pyschiatrist. She wanted to put me on the medications that my sister is on (she has bipolar depression) to see if they'd help. Lexapro has improved my panic attacks a ton, and my anxiety is definitely lessened. My depression is still about the same, but I've noticed that the Seroquel she gave me to 'help me sleep' makes me really fucked up - I took the normal dosage I'm prescribed last night (25 mg) and was hallucinating, my body was numb, and I ended up sleeping till 5 pm, while waking up off and on. Is this normal? Should I be looking for a different medication or something else for my depression? looking for advice, thanks &lt;3"

bipolar,Rocklobster111213,2020/3/23,"Advice needed for a family member Would love if someone could give some advice about the right course of action my family should take. 

My younger brother has gone through what seemed like depressive periods for several years without anything (seemingly) severe or requiring medical help (though perhaps that wasn't the case). 

He's now 19. 2-3 weeks ago his personality, mood, and even voice seemed to change rapidly. He sent a cruel and lengthy text highlighting long-past imagined or real transgressions to his closest friend. He essentially told him that he never wanted to see him again, then bragged about it and shared his message with said friend's other friends. He started to complain and speak *much* more openly about elements of family members, strangers, and friends that disgusted him.

He's also become absorbed with new projects and tasks that keep him busy all hours of the day. He would say nothing and disappear for a day or more. His filter started to disappear and he would say things to my mother to intentionally try to scare her. While I would never try to diagnose him myself, he and I have an older brother who has bipolar II and recognized warning signs of what he believed to be emerging hypomania. 

My younger brother now sleeps *very* little, and speaks quickly and with a pressured tone. He has isolated many of his old friends and has choice insults to explain why he despises them. He complained (before he stopped communicating openly with his family) of racing thoughts and an inability to sleep. 

While I finish grad school, he and I have been sharing a room at my parents. A few days ago he exploded on me for being a messy person and spent hours saying the most hurtful things, panting from seeming exertion, muttering to himself, and laughing with the most bizarre cadence. The next morning he acted as though nothing had happened. 

He seems to have a largely newfound utter confidence in his abilities and self, never apologizing or even showing the slightest doubt that his speech or behavior was entirely appropriate.
He also doesn't allow others to talk to him if they don't agree with him; he cuts them off and berates them. All of this is a complete change from the personality he had for the first 18 years of his life. 

Another family member visited and saw what was happening. He discovered our brother had taken his gun and deposited it in his car trunk. Out of concern, he took the gun. Said younger brother became enraged when he discovered this and started to threaten this family member with legal action, etc. We also found he has plans to buy a pistol from a local person he found online. He tries to start a verbal altercation with *everyone*.



At this point I'm concerned for my family, my brother seems to be intermittently entirely in control of himself, but he has progressively isolated everyone who cares about him. 

If he keeps escalating it won't be long before he's kicked out with no money, job, or connections. 

My parents are afraid of him and ask me if he's a danger to them or their young children and I have no idea. I've worked at a psych hospital and abhor the idea of him being committed were things to devolve further. I'm also worried he'll refuse to see a professional, crash, and get errantly prescribed an SSRI, making things worse. 

Does anyone have advice I can give to my parents. He may be delusional, but I don't believe he's at all psychotic. And while he may be verbally abusive, he hasn't physically harmed anyone. Is there a modus operandi in situations like this where it will be difficult to get a diagnosis or treatment in the foreseeable future? He is tearing our family apart, but we aren't about to push him out onto the street due to a possible emerging mental illness.

Thank you!"

I am 17, I have diagnosed asd, adhd, OCD, anxiety (multiple forms) and panic disorder. 

Since I was about 11/12 I've had these highs where I barely eat, I can't sleep, and I just start project after project, never finishing them. I always thought that ADHD could cause these manic symptoms, but recently I looked it up and apparently ADHD doesn't cause the mania I feel. 
This is always followed by a period where I'm overly tired and binge eat. 
I hate self diagnosis, and I don't think I fit the criteria for full bipolar disorder as my cycles are short and recurrent rather than long and spaced out. 

Then last week I did a project on bipolar disorder for AP psych and when looking at the criteria for cyclothymic disorder I realised I fit it. Each and every one.

All clubs and stuff are disbanded probably for the rest of semester and we're not supposed to stand within 6ft of each other when we're on campus.

My friends at school are either scared and isolating or going back to where they are from to work from there. I am from another country, continent, hemisphere, and don't have enough money to leave - I also wouldn't be comfortable being at home because a lot has changed since I left. Even my doctor and psychologist won't meet in person. So I am essentially cut off from everyone at the moment and my mood is suffering badly.

I've tried to be consistent with sleep, food, exercise, and work, but it's so hard to motivate myself when there is no one around.

It took me two and a half months to pick myself back up, and right when things were really starting to look up this pandemic struck. I have to be fully quarantined because my dad became very sick with upper respiratory symptoms yesterday, and I was around him a lot on Saturday. We're waiting on the coronavirus test results to get back, they said it could take up to 5 days. I'm not supposed to leave the house at all, and I just wasn't mentally or physically prepared for things to get like this. It all feels so surreal. I live alone so I don't have anyone around to help keep me from getting too stuck in my head and spiraling. 

I never had that much of an issue with anxiety but now I find myself anxious and paranoid about everything. Being forced to go back into isolation (I basically isolated myself for like 4 months because of my episode) has just thrown me back into the depths of depression. My eating disorder relapsed. I can't focus on or enjoy anything, I feel totally brain dead. My medication seemed like it was finally starting to work well but now it's like it's not working at all. I wish I could look forward to doing art projects, reading, or doing anything productive with my time but all I've been able to do is lay in bed staring at the wall.

My friends all live far away and are supporting me saying I can video call them anytime, but now I'm too depressed to even want to talk to them.

My dad gets sick all the time, he has a problem with his tonsils which he was actually going to have removed this week but that got canceled along with everything else. We're hoping his illness is just from that, but I'm a bit worried with his age and not knowing if having chronic tonsillitis would put him more at risk if he does have COVID-19.

I really feel for everyone as we all deal with this, the only good I've seen from all this is how everyone is really supporting eachother. I especially feel bad for everyone out there with any kind of mental illness being completely thrown off like I am. Not to mention the financial disaster as well, my family has been heavily impacted financially.

bipolar,lollo67,2020/4/10,"Is there something else like Lamotrigine? Always been a little up-and-down person, very sensitive overall. I can see some resemblance from bipolar light diagnosis.

My real problems started 15 years ago, together with heavy weightlifting at that time, developed a severe posture of upper/lower crossed syndrome, from my body constantly being in fight/flight mode. Affected the stressystem heavily and I¡¯ve not been able to come back to and stability since then. The extreme tight muscles affected the anxiety/depressions and it was shooting it through the roof. I continued a few years more but at last I had to go to psychiatric emergency. I¡¯ve tried a lot of meds during the years. Mostly SSRI, SNRI plus a few others.

All the meds that has lifted my mood has at the same time triggered muscle tensions as if my brain see it as a threat and the fight/flight mode is on. SSRI has this effect almost immediately, at the same time it makes me more creative but make the system go overdrive (is it making perhaps light bipolar or any adhd symptoms worse?) it has really destroyed everything I cared for in life, all activity, social contacts, relationships, career etc..

Lamictal was the only medicine that has really worked to lower the tensions and also raising my mood and stable the anxiety. After some research I think it¡¯s worked better than others because of the glutamate antagonism. After that I¡¯ve tried Valproate/Depakote, Cymbalta, Amitriptyline with not the same success. Also I¡¯m really sensitive to norepinephrine in the last two ones. Lyrica helps relaxing the nerves a little for a few hours but makes me feel really slow and dumb.

Are there any other medications that work on minimizing glutamate and have uplifting effect same as Lamictal?

How about newer atypical antipsychotics? Is it worth trying (don¡¯t like the idea of playing with dopamine receptors. Rexulti, Vraylar? I tried Abilify for a few days and it really made me creative but same there, it triggered and activated the tensions. I don¡¯t know if it would continue because I dropped it after a few days. 

I know there¡¯s Gabapentin, Topimax, maybe Trileptal?

bipolar,CreepyYard,2020/4/1,"I'm very confused! I (22F) went from being a fairly unmotivated, sad high schooler who did everything at the absolute last minute (if at all) to a remarkably over-involved college student who is consistently a little bit of a mess, in part because she occasionally slips into periods where she sometimes can't even really move for a couple of days, but it's really not that big of a deal because she's doing so much better than she was before. My best friend has dubbed these little pockets of behavior my ""Eeyore days,"" and almost everyone in my life has come to understand and work around them. 

When the pandemic happened and college campuses (including mine) emptied, I threw myself into every opportunity available to me- if someone proposed a petition or a Facebook page or a form or a fund, I spearheaded it. I was doing several large projects by myself, simultaneously, and without any regard to my own situation. I went a week and a half rarely sleeping, eating, showering, or checking my emails and messages. I was working so hard to fix other people's problems that I almost wound up homeless myself. 

Eventually, I crashed into a full-on Eeyore week after a massive screaming match with someone over the phone about literally nothing (I don't really remember the argument but apparently I barely sounded like I was speaking English). I've living with some friends, and we all sort of assumed that it was the product of being overworked, which has been the explanation for all other previous Eeyore days. I'm significantly more functional right now (look, I'm typing this!), although time has gotten really confusing and I still find myself lapsing into hours where movement becomes difficult. One thing that I have been able to do is go through the small mountain of emails that I've gathered in the past few weeks while letting YouTube autoplay me whatever Vine compilation or reveal video it wants to. One email is from my current therapist. I've only been with her for a few months, but one of my friends found her info in my calendar and called on my behalf in the middle of my Eeyore week. My friend explained everything, and now she and my therapist think I'm bipolar, likely bipolar 2. 

I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression before, as well as some other things (OCD, ADHD, autism, etc) that didn't wind up sticking. I (briefly) tried medication (Zoloft) at 19 after it was discovered that I've been self harming since I was 10, but it made things worse so I stopped taking it and have been somewhat opposed to medicating myself ever since. But somehow, this diagnosis feels different, which is probably why I've been ghosting my therapist and letting myself slip back into full-on Eeyore. But hey, at least I know I'm doing it! 

I still don't know if I trust this diagnosis (if it even is a real diagnosis), but I definitely know that something's up and, for what it's worth, I've been reluctantly resonating with good ol' internet mental health resources. So here I am on Reddit, asking for the opinions of total strangers on the internet! I won't take your actual advice (I'll defer to my therapist, I swear), but I would love to hear experiences because I'm super sketched out by false diagnoses. 

I'm sorry for the long post and my apologies if this isn't exactly what this page is meant for- no hard feelings if you want to delete/mute/hide (idk I'm new here) this post.

I realized that I often become obsessed with things like anime and fantasy movies (e.g. Lord of the Rings) during depressive episodes to escape reality. Then I realize that I am stuck in this world and can never be a part of the fantasy world and that somewhat worsens the depression. Does anyone else here go through this too?

I get annoyed by the littlest things &amp; will let it effect my whole mood/day, sometimes I have bad thoughts but am able to pull myself out of them. I change my mind on things a lot during the day or even the week, one day I feel that I can do anything, then other days I have no motivation to do anything. 

Like last night, I had the sudden urge to do dishes @ 9:30pm, i'm usually a lazy shit &amp; just sit on my ass all night. But last night, I felt the need to clean. This morning before work, I vacuumed 2 rooms just cause I was so annoyed by how they looked &amp; felt the need to, usually its hard for me to get out of bed &amp; I always go back to sleep and end up being late for work. Not today.. Idk if i'm just overthinking or not, but just kind of looking for advice &amp; if I should bring it up to my doctor.. I already take medication for depression &amp; anxiety, maybe I need those meds adjusted or something. 

Please no negative comments, just looking for some advice or people who have the same problems!"
bipolar,angelicpickle,2020/2/6,"Has anyone diagnosed bipolar actually ended up in reality being autistic? I've been diagnosed with BPD. A few years ago when I had a manic episode I was brought to the hospital for a few months until doctors could get me settled. During that time I went from being diagnosed as schizophrenic and borderline/ multiple personality disorder then finally fell on to the bipolar diagnosis. I had been doing some research of my own that correlates heavily with autism the struck more of a chord with me. I have always had issues socially. Since I was very young, for example, I remember not quite understanding how to mesh with other people, and mimicking what I thought was normal behaviour, except with very close friends and family. 


My voice patterns changes a lot. I've always been obsessive with and exclusive with what I like, which I know can be common among anyone. I hate when my patterns are disrupted and have melt downs when they are. I don't know how to have normal conversations with people, I never know how to, or feel inclined to start them. When I get excited about something I can become socially unaware and have no filter. I can become enthralled with small things like pouring water between glasses over and over for example. Idk, there are lots of things that have me feeling that this seems like a more appropriate diagnosis, and just that no one has considered it. After entering my twenties and living on my own I have adapted to be able to have somewhat normal interactions with people, but it drains me so much, and I need to retreat often. I dont know what is real or manifested from simply trying to adapt. A lot of the bipolar symptoms really match up too, but so much of it is overlapping. How do you know for sure?


Has anyone else with bipolar disorder felt this way?

Maybe I'm just thinking too much. Antidepressants seem to help a little."

I panicked and thought there was something wrong I called my psychiatrist at the time and all she recommended was Benedryl. Now that I've been on the medication for a few years I still get this quite dten. Not to the extremes, but once I take my medication if I am not asleep after a while I get this horrific feeling of anxiety or something that makes me want to crawl out of my own skin, it's almost excruciating. Unfortunately, this has caused me to use my kolonopin to cope with these side effects while I should be saving it for real panic attacks. I find my psychiatrist is not very easy to talk to and she just chalks it up as a side effect. I am just curious if anyone is going through the same experiences and if you guys have any good coping methods for this. I appreciate it, thank you."
bipolar,cyrukus,2020/1/12,"How to deal with my Rapid Cycle Bipolar Mother My mother got diagnosed in the start of December, has been on lithium for two weeks now, 1st week 400mg and the 2nd week 600mg (this was increased after a 2 day manic episode during which I kinda had a private breakdown for an hour or two) 

I'm wondering how I should act and talk to her. I know I should ask her psychologist and I will try and do that if I can get her alone. Also what I've been doing is avoiding contact as much as possible but I also sort of had an argument or two with her and from what Ive seen online its not good to engage a manic person like that and that it'd be better to diffuse the situation or change the topic. Also I'm an adult, late 20s

I¡¯ve been diagnosed with bipolar type II for 5 years now and have tried many medications. I¡¯ve been on Quetiapine (Seroquel) for roughly 4 years - it works pretty well for me I still have slight manic and depressive episodes but hardly noticeable. My doctor wants me to switch my medications because of some long term affects of the medication she isn¡¯t comfortable with so I¡¯ve been looking at my options. 

I have never taken more than one medication at a time for my symptoms but am very aware that most of the bipolar population has their own ¡°cocktails¡± that help manage all their different symptoms. If you all would be willing to tell me what you¡¯re on and which medications are for what I would greatly appreciate it so I¡¯m able to get a better grasp on which medications are more targeted towards different symptom management. 

For a bit of background if anyone is wondering I struggle with what I¡¯d consider moderate anxiety almost daily, irritability, and ¡°depressive¡± states (flat lined personality / no drive, sleeping way too much) these are my biggest problem areas! 

Thank you in advance!!

bipolar,Equivalent-Blueberry,2020/2/19,"Does anyone else have to convince themselves that they really are Bipolar? I was recently diagnosed with bipolar II two weeks ago after a 2 year long process of trying different antidepressants to treat unipolar depression and GAD. I finally switched from my gp to an actual psychiatrist and she was pretty confident that I was actually bipolar. I guess when she explained it I do fit the mould for it due to my questionable decisions, impulse control, and obviously the rapid cycling between moods. I¡¯ve been prescribed remeron and trileptal and I feel SO much better. Even after all this, I still find myself doubting wether or not I actually have this disorder. I guess when I think of bpd I imagine people who are totally out of control, whereas I¡¯m very successful in school and work, however my personal life is a totally different story. Anyways, does anyone else feel this way? I just can¡¯t wrap my head around this being an actual disease that I have now."
bipolar,nonsequitous,2020/3/2,"I can't explain my symptoms, so I do stupid things. (should also be flaired as suicide, but I could only choose one) BD2. Often i become sad and depressed due to disparate antecedents. One failure here, a passing thought there, some precision strike reminder of the past. All of this coalesces, and I become depressed without really know what thing predominated the sadness. I'm open and vulnerable to negative thoughts, I have a grab bag of reasons to be hopeless, but I don't think I could give a good account of ""this time, x set me off, and compounded over the course of y days"". 

So I keep worrying that this situation is all a mistake, that the fundamental wrongness within me isn't BD, but something else (who knows what). Recently, clinical markers have pervaded my mind; I worried that this depressive spell would end before the 4th day (which is apparently the minimum amount of time to consider depressive symptoms as an ""episode""). I worry that this made me lean into my depression, just to hit that benchmark. I constantly worry about every moment of laughter. I notice the fact that I can still interact with people out in the world without much dysfunction. It doesn't really add up to me. 

I know that BD is a lifelong condition. I know that many people are in long-term therapy. I recently read articles online about how long to see a therapist; they all noted how trauma tends to lengthen the process considerably. The fact that bipolar wasn't mentioned was somehow incredibly devastating, even with what I'm already aware of. I know that the pain of trauma, from whatever source, is a terrible burden, but I would almost take it I think. I'm going crazy at the muddled state of my own condition. 

So the old fears (that I shouldn't feel this way, that I have no reason, that my mind is fooling me) have come out of the closet again. This time though, I've been strangling myself over the weekend. I did it once last year when I was incredibly depressive and suicidal and incredibly angry. Then as now, it's more a matter of self-punishment than a suicide attempt. It's also how the pain is strangely and paradoxically and stupidly comforting. It's taking out the frustration about yourself on yourself. It's also to perversely prove to myself that I'm not normal, that this lack of energy and motivation is not normal, that thinking about buying a rope, no matter how idly, is not normal. I think it's also some form of preparation, getting used to pain, inflicting it on myself, growing numb. Every time I strangle myself though, afterwards I hold my head in my hands and wonder why the fuck I'm doing this. 

It's all too normalised. I don't really have a centre anymore. I don't have a good sense of what solid ground feels like."

Can someone chime in and tell me that it's not ""impossible"" to be regulated and have a better than your average American fitness level. 

As a note I powerlift and do not think she needs to be ""thin"" or look like a model or bikini competitor.

I have always tried and be positive with her and listen to not only what she is saying, bit feeling ECT .

bipolar,melind64,2020/2/16,"Why are such subs ALLOWED? Have you ever heard of the antipsychiatry movement?

It's   basically a scientology cult that denies the existence of mental   illness and anything that has to do with psychology and psychiatry.   Things like these could greatly affect us. Some people need help out   there and they just oppose it. It's sick.

This subreddit: [r/antipsychiatry](https://www.reddit.com/r/antipsychiatry/) describes it.

Are they just schizophrenics who are unmedicated or what?? Because  the most common symptom of schizophrenia is usually DENIAL.

I  suffer from schizophrenia and I find it offensive for me and everybody  else affected with mental illness. Because they say it's all a myth.

Imagine  if a person with schizophrenia or any delusional disorder actually  believes them and stops or won't take treatment at all, it can harm him  and the people around him. This is very serious. Or what if someone is  suicidal and needs help? This can cause a lot of damage people.

I am trying to spread this on many mental health communities because maybe something can be achieved.

Have you ever heard about cases where people died because they were  following  their conspiracy cure instead of having a real medical care?  Whether it was a cancer cure or whatever. Similar things can happen  here! Your Bipolar is considered a joke to them.

Check the most upvoted posts of [r/antipsychiatry](https://www.reddit.com/r/antipsychiatry/) and you'll see what I mean.

THIS IS NOT ONLY OFFENSIVE BUT ALSO DAMAGING."
bipolar,HotRocksStayHot,2020/4/9,"Bipolar getting worse over time? Medications no longer working? Hi everyone, this is my first post.

Does anyone else feel like their illness is getting worse? I used to go months or even years between episodes, and the time between episodes it always seemed like I went back to my normal self. I also seemed to respond much better to medication, and didn't get so many mixed episodes.

Now it seems like I'm never back to normal, like there's no time between episodes. It seems like I'm chronically depressed, and then have a manic/mixed episode every couple months, then back to depression. It's like I never get a break anymore, it never seems to end. And medications don't seem to help that much anymore, just keep me from becoming too suicidal or psychotic, but I'm barely able to function even with a mood stabilizer, antidepressant, and antipsychotic as well as sleeping meds.

I can't tell if this is typical for bipolar disorder, like it tends to become more chronic/severe and treatment resistant over time, or if my meds aren't working anymore (have only been on my current meds for about a year, so that doesn't seem like much time), or if it's another mental health problem that's making me feel so depressed/anxious all the time (also diagnosed with PTSD but have been dealing with this for 7 years now). I know this would be a good thing to discuss with a psychiatrist, but I have only been seeing a primary care doctor for the past few months and she doesn't seem to know a whole lot about mental illness/psych meds, so that's why I'm looking for advice here.

I'm worried that if things are already this difficult to manage and I'm only 30, what will it be like in 10, 20, 30+ years? I feel so guilty for constantly putting my boyfriend through this with no hope that it'll get easier, we've been together for over 7 years now and I know it's hard for him too. I'm worried I won't be able to work like this, if things keep getting worse. I'm trying to hold on to some hope that maybe I'll find the right medication and I'll be fine, but I'm having a hard time being optimistic right now. Feels like I'm at a very low point and the only thing keeping me going is my boyfriend and his family, because I can't stand the thought of hurting them.

Thanks in advance for any advice or thoughts shared, I appreciate anyone taking the time to read this."
bipolar,wandering-sol,2020/1/19,"New to all of this... I¡¯ve spent the last few years dealing with what I thought was depression only to see a Psychiatrist this week, to get back on antidepressants, and have them say I have Bipolar Disorder. Definitely caught me off guard but after talking about it with them, I could see some aspects from earlier decisions during highs that would fit it. 

I¡¯m usually introverted and sometimes social gatherings at bars are super out of my comfort zone, but then I have moments where I¡¯m super into the vibe and get into the whole dancing (when I¡¯m normally one of those people whose swaying side to side to avoid being totally obvious about my discomfort) and these are moments where my friends hype me up because they never see me like that and think it¡¯s fun. Obviously this isn¡¯t something I¡¯d consider a problem, but rather me coming out of my shell. Although I will say I could see how this is a problem when I drink enough. 

Oh, I¡¯m also one of those people that is quick to say yes to last-minute plans despite other responsibilities. I tend to say yes to too many things and end up feeling overwhelmed by it all because I never back out of things. I also tend to say yes to hang outs I¡¯m not into - eg., a friend of mine has been super into raves and EDM concerts lately and when I go, I end up feeling regret for having said yes and discomfort. 

Another thing I definitely noticed and felt clicked with me is the money mishandling. Last night, for a friend¡¯s birthday outing, I gave myself a budget of $200. I had spent $100 of that and there was absolutely no need for me to spend anymore, it was good place to stop but it¡¯s almost like my brain was like ¡°do it, it¡¯s there. You already gave yourself the space to do it¡± despite my logic freaking out about having already spent that much in the first place. 

I¡¯m not really sure what the point of this post was; I guess I just needed to vent and sort my thoughts about this out a little bit.

bipolar,YedZeppelin,2020/2/22,"How to rehabilitate properly to go into the work force after being diagnosed BP disorder? I'm a couple months shy of 27 and was only medicated when I was 14-15. From 18, it took me 6 1/2 years (with a year off) to finish a 4 year degree at 25. Addiction was in my life, but I felt ultimately had helped me pawn off alot of the anxiety I was having. However, over the years I became more and more clean. But around graduation,I was having panic attacks and decided that I wasn't going to walk, it seemed too dramatized and a waste of time. However, I did have a ticket to see Robert Plant live for the first time a couple months after my graduation date, so that was my celebratory reward for myself. 

I'd always worked a job since I was 16, mostly in retail until I got into community college. There I ended up being a supporting instructor for English and math classes, and I ran with it and tutoring for a long while. Addiction was in my life and I wasn't fully ""present"" even though I was able to hold multiple jobs. I ended up not working my last couple years of school to focus on my studies and did exceptionally well. However, I wasn't building relationships with the people I was surrounded by, I was not able to get myself involved in really any of the activities. I was keeping to my myself with some friends not school associated and had relationships.

After looking for jobs, I wasn't able to really land anything in my area and the stress of the struggle drove me nearly quite insane. I ended up having a bad bipolar break after being put on steroids by my PCP had an allergic reaction and was hospitalized. I almost had a heart attack while being inpatient for 2 weeks. When I got out, the large dosage of medication they had me on was way too much and caused my condition to get a great deal worse.

After 6 months I picked up a retail job that I was overqualified for, and had ongoing depression. Quit my job, ended up going back to school for a certificate and ended up having a severe manic episode that led to a 30 day inpatient. This was 2 months ago, since then I've been rehabilitating the best I can. The medicine I'm on this time seems to be working, even though there's an underlying depression since I'm so far off path where I'd like to be. It's difficult to engage in what's left of old relationships and anxiety is so bad sometimes, forming new ones seems almost impossible at times.

Recently I was applying to part time jobs for the hell of it which actually reaped responses, helping my self esteem and even a phone interview. I nearly cried before it I was so nervous, but it was simple and I totally had over-prepared. It's hard for me to accept that I'm at the spot I'm at, but I know that if I practice getting into the workforce and build confidence, then I'll get on the high horse quicker than before. Sometimes I forget that I'm not alone in this struggle and ultimately wanted to share."

bipolar,lunalavendermoon,2020/2/24,"anxious, frustrated, and feeling of doom.... (politics warning) I do not want to start up controversy but I am actually afraid of what¡¯s going on in the country right now and am apprehensive towards fellow Americans. I don¡¯t want to debate anyone on this sub as this is a support sub so if politics is a heated topic for you and you agree with me you might enjoy, if you don¡¯t agree with me you probably won¡¯t enjoy this post but I want to be clear this is not meant to cause controversy or debate. 

All of my core principles as a person are to do unto others as you would want to have done unto yourself, having compassion, empathy, support the needs of people especially those who need it the most, I believe in integrity, justice, fairness, equity, caring for the needs of people and living as one essentially the song Imagine by John Lennon(haha). Which is why I am an avid Bernie Sanders supporter because of all those reasons and concepts being mirrored into policy and the concept of breaking a corrupt system that is structured to only benefit a few while the rest struggle which is a reality. And no it¡¯s not just because it¡¯s cool and I¡¯m young, I have supported is campaign since 2015 and have informed myself a lot on the beliefs I¡¯m voting for. 

The blatant ignorance and uninformed mentality a lot of Americans though makes me feel overwhelmingly frustrated. The denial of reality and perpetuate lies going on is endless, of course it¡¯s been this way for a lot time it has only become more divisive. I feel incredibly passionate about this and am not going to talk about all the things I believe in because I mostly want to address my emotions about it and I¡¯m not handling it well.

I recently feel VERY on edge about politics. It¡¯s a very touchy topic for me and I¡¯ve cried multiple times within the last month over this particularly and the frustration and anxiety that I have is so intense that I can physically feel it in my chest throughout most of the day. My heart feels heavy (I know I sound like an over dramatic cry baby but this is how I feel) I actually feel so emotionally burdened to the point of wanting to kill myself because I cannot handle the let down of everything I believe in morally being lost to everything that I loath about humanity, lies, injustice, corruption, social hierarchy (in this case money), the needs of struggling people being ignored, the distortion of reality, the lack of compassion and empathy.

I feel like I am going to crack. What doesn¡¯t help is that sadly the majority of people I know are not voting or care at all and the other are huge trump supporters or generally very right leaning. There are only a handful of people in my life or that I see at all that support some degree of what I support. I don¡¯t want to have hate in my heart because that makes me no better but I feel incredibly angry towards the ignorance and lack of compassion of these people that I know who support these things. I¡¯m starting to lose faith in humanity and just starting to doubt myself and I  feel like an idiot for caring so much about other people because the majority that I know seem to not care at all. I feel overwhelming anxiety that is a bundle of irritability and sadness. I know these emotions are being exacerbated by my current mood state being more depressive leaning but also I feel this is sprinkling some mixed state in which is typically what I deal with."

bipolar,Flyingbangtan,2020/3/15,"How does one deal with the added stress of having a period? I'm a woman who was very recently diagnosed with bipolar. My meds, and some changes in behaviour in general, were really working for me, and I was very slowly moving towards some emotional stability. But then I got my period and my hormones made me relapse in every way. I was having many drastic mood changes within a day, and I guess that has happened before, but in contrast with my recent almost stability, it was very scary. I raised my dosage by myself to keep the situation under control, and it feels like I fucked up by doing that, even though it did help and there were no side effects. There's still some weeks until I see my psychiatrist, so what, really, can I do at this point? And how does everyone else cope with hormones and bipolar?"

bipolar,jacob-gold97,2020/1/27,"Are these delusions? Basically, I've been thinking for the past 10 hours or so about how everything that I know might be false and existence might be fake. I started doubting science, history, that people I know have minds. For a brief moment I started thinking that maybe existence is actually a trap and the only way to escape it and get back to the true reality is suicide. I've had a few experiences like this before, where I think that all of reality might be fake, and then begin to almost *experience* it--though I can't really describe what that means; its something like the lens through which I view the world as a coherent and logical whole falls away and I'm left utterly baffled by the existence of the universe as it is.

To be clear, I do study a lot of philosophy, and these thoughts just started off as philosophical thought experiments on the nature of Being. But it's had a strange effect on the way I experienced my day today in a tangible way.

bipolar,Communist__Robot,2020/2/12,"Sleep Disturbances on antipsychotics? I took Seroquel for quite some time before I realized it was the cause of my nightmares, sleepwalking, and terrifying hallucinations. I got off it in 2017 and didn't replace it with anything. 

Two weeks ago, my psychiatrist prescribed Saphris 2.5mg due to my manic episodes being out of control. It's worked surprisingly well, but some of my old symptoms have come back. I apparently scared my partner half to death by screaming bloody murder in the middle of the night Sunday, I took a nap alone at home and work up to all of my cabinet doors open, and I've had nightmares every night the past week. I tried Prazosin once for nightmares, but even the 1mg left me debilitated for a few days. 

I'm just wondering if this has happened to anyone else and, if so, how did you deal with it? I like how stable I seem to be on Saphris, but I'm worried about my nightly activities are going to have a negative impact on my relationship."
bipolar,skeletonsmama,2020/2/3,"Aussies with bipolar: why doesn't the PBS reconisge the need for us to take anti-pyschotics and use anti-epileptics etc.? I've been diagnosed with BP2 and essentially left alone on lithium with a PRN after a 8 year history of severe depression (and unrecognised hypomania) and 2 years previous being treated with SSRI. 

Lithium hasn't been working, so seeing a pysch again and getting a feel for what drugs I might get prescribed and I find that all the drugs commonly combined or used instead of lithium as a mood stabiliser, including anti-psychotics of almost any type, are restricted.

Meaning, unless a GP or pysch lies and says I have schizophrenia or epilepsy, I have to pay full price for these drugs which, I presume, has been proven to be effective for bipolar (otherwise why else would they be so prevelently prescribed). I don't know what goes in to approving drugs for other uses on the PBS. But I'm just. Confused.


What would it take to get 'used in treatment of depressive bipolar' added to the PBS for Lamictal? Or Latuda? Or any of the other common drugs. This isn't off label use, necessarily. Especially not when you're hypo and psychotic.

I¡¯m a grad student and my mental health has significantly declined since starting grad school in August.

I have always been high functioning but have been in a steady decline over the years. I don¡¯t know what to do because outwardly I seem happy and high functioning.

bipolar,thefuturesbeensold,2020/4/13,"Struggling with rumination in my relationship First off just to give some back story, ive (f 27) been with my partner (m 28)for 2 years. He is the most amazing man who i adore, hes affectionate, loving and the most supportive person ive ever met in regards to my BP. No one can make me laugh like he does, we have an undeniable connection and i am not here to find fault with him. However like with most relationships there have been difficult times where he has done things that have deeply upset me. (This post is not to discuss these things)these events have betrayed my trust and made me feel insecure and not good enough. We have discussed these things at length and i know 100% the remorse and full responsibility he has taken. 

I am not a easy person to be with, although he spends every minute of every day trying to convince me otherwise. He has never once raised his voice or used my mental health against me, even though alot of my feelings of anger and insecurity are likely because of my bipolar brain and probably not rational responses, but he has never said this and always takes full responsibility. In October i attempted suicide and he supported me every step of the way in trying to recover. 

Despite us moving forward and having an amazing healthy relationship full of love and communication i still cannot stop myself relaying over and over in my brain anything that has ever upset me. Non stop  everyday. The best way i can describe it is when you find out something really awful (like someone dying) and that sinking feeling you get the next morning when you wake up and remember it. i feel this sensation constantly throughout the day. I know this isn't normal, and I've done some research on rumination which can be a common thing in people with mood disorders, but knowing this doesnt make it any less painful and i don't want this to ruin my relationship because i know deep down i love him and he loves me. 

I'm not sure what advice there really is but i just wanted to try and get it into words mainly. Some days i feel like my brain might actually explode, or like i just want to switch it off. I feel lost and like i am reaching the end of what i can handle.

bipolar,sageandcitrus,2020/2/5,"Misdiagnosed for years - new breastfeeding mama in an intense mixed episode seeking advice / encouragement Background info:
A while back (like 10 years ago) a doctor suspected bipolar 2, but my drug use and general distrust of doctors hindered the transparency that an actual diagnosis warranted until recently, at age 28.

My daughter turned two months old the other day. We have been on and off of formula for about a month due to her sensitivity to dairy (until the protein is largely cleared from my system, or low enough to pass to her). Last appointment we were told formula for 2 weeks, clear the dairy, and resume breastfeeding. 

We hit that two week break yesterday, but in that month and two weeks, I was prescribed a new med for what I thought was worsening depression PPD/PPA.

Wrong.

I was prescribed buspar for my increasing anxiety. I felt amazing for two or three days, and until this morning, had been having a fucking AWFUL mixed episode. 

Thankfully, with a psychiatrist in the family, I was able to at least talk through these changes with someone I trusted, and he opened my eyes to the fact that my meds didn¡¯t just stop working, I was on Zoloft and now buspar, and that likely threw me into this episode.

CURRENT ISSUE: 

My question is, not having had amazing success with Abilify long term, have any mamas (or daddies that remember) had success with being able to remain breastfeeding while on a medication for bipolar? 

I¡¯m reading that most of these meds may be molecularly too large to pass to babe in high amounts, but I¡¯m not a doctor.

My options are seeming like Latuda or Abilify, that my doctor is moderately comfortable with anyway, for now until I get an appointment with a new psychiatrist.

bipolar,TheDarkHeadache,2020/2/25,"The Big 3 Is it PTSD? Is it Borderline Personality Disorder? Or is It Bipolar?

So had an appointment with a new psychiatrist last week and we have got ourselves a working diagnosis of PTSD, this is based upon things like my parents separating when I was a child, the arguments and physicality and that my mum had PND after I was born. However now that I¡¯ve had a week of my brain working itself into a tornado, I¡¯ve come to the conclusion that personally I don¡¯t feel my childhood was traumatic to any degree. I lived with my mum and still saw my dad frequently, he did disappear for a year but once the connection had been fixed everything¡¯s as normal again. The physicality was more getting a few slaps when I¡¯d got into trouble at home or school.

I¡¯m still adamant that I have bipolar disorder and the more I speak to people with the illness, including my uncle, the more I¡¯m told my symptoms are identical to theirs, however PTSD, BPD and Bipolar all look the same and sound the same until you look deeper into the narrative, I¡¯m fairly confident I don¡¯t have PTSD as I¡¯m not avoiding situations because of previous traumatic experiences, I¡¯m not thinking back to traumatic times and me waking up every 2/3 hours while I sleep is not because of nightmares.

The reason I¡¯m avoiding going out, meeting up with friends or even working is because 1. I¡¯m highly volatile mood and temper wise presently and 2. I¡¯ve taken a bit of a knock to my confidence, where I have secluded myself for the past 2 years while I¡¯m awaiting a diagnosis and 3. I don¡¯t want to fall back into the heavy drinking and recklessness of taking cocaine because I feel with my compulsions and nature I¡¯d fall back into that lifestyle very quickly, no mater how hard I try to avoid it. 

Maybe it is PTSD, I¡¯m no expert and I don¡¯t know what my sub conscious is thinking, but deep down I don¡¯t feel like this is what I¡¯m battling, and personally feel that PTSD has been pulled out of the bag because it poses the least risk to my health, where if they said bipolar or bpd it would mean and increase in medication and putting myself at more risk of side effects, which is also what the psychiatrist kept saying throughout my appointment. 

The only thing I can do is play along and see what the outcome is with this EMDR therapy, even though I have nothing which I consider traumatic to talk about and think is a waste of my time and the NHS¡¯s money and resources."
bipolar,SakuraCha,2020/1/24,"How do you know if you're bipolar? My doctor recently asked me if I am bipolar because I was seeking help for depression and anxiety and mentioned feeling manic every few months.

bipolar,patbaenlothmartucci,2020/4/6,"this had a title at first, but then it got longer, so now it's ""lthe stuff I've always wanted to post about on a message board but didn't because I thought nobody will respond"" 
I'm a 26 y/o guy from the US, and I'm on SSDI (social security disability insurance) for bipolar disorder and severe ADHD. Basically what this means is that I get $1300 a month and high-quality health insurance from the government, funded by taxpayers, because in their eyes I'm deemed unable to work and hold/sustain a job. And if we're being completely honest, I would agree with that; I've been fired from every job I've ever had, despite putting forth genuine effort. However, I still feel incredibly ashamed it; it's kind of my biggest existential issue right now. 

The main reason for that, I think, is because I'm pretty sure anyone who met me would be very surprised to find out that I get these benefits. I don't want to sound cocky or like I have a big ego, but I think (and I think most people that know me would agree) that I come off as an exceptionally capable/impressionable/likable person; that I'm articulate, funny (when I'm not depressed, which is most the time), tall, good looking, and very intelligent. 

(I absolutely cannot stress how much I hate saying those things, and I promise I never say them out loud to other people/make it seem like I even think them. I try really hard to be humble, and I hate people who put themselves above others.

Anyway though, I think it'd be fair to say that emotionally speaking my childhood was really rough. I was born almost 3 months premature, and my mom died during childbirth. On the other hand, my dad is a very hard/cold/judgemental/emotionally nonexistent/stern/authoritarian person (I'm very sure that he has aspergers to some degree). He loves me and has always worked very hard to provide for me, but I've never felt emotionally close to or loved for who I am by him (more on that later). I also have a stepmom, who my dad remarried when I was 4. We've gotten closer since I've grown up, but when I was a kid she was very distant and had no involvement in my parenting; she and my dad have a ""traditional"" relationship, and I think she was intimidated by my issues when they started popping up. So overall, I've always struggled with severe loneliness; feeling unliked/unwanted/misunderstood by anyone and everyone. The only exception was my grandma, whom I still tear up whenever I think about. She would always tell me how cute and special I was, buy me candy, and show me off to all of her friends. 

I was essentially reading by age 3 though, and when I went to school I got tested pretty much immediately. It put my IQ at 136, which made my dad very happy. I got A's grades without trying, had people telling me I was going to change the world, etc. And again, I guess if we're being honest I liked it; it did make
me feel good about myself.

Along with reading, at that same time (age 3-4) I fell DISGUSTINGLY in love with video games. I had no siblings or peers, so I drowned in the fantasy stuff. It was, and still is, the best. So of course it makes sense that my actual social life, upon going to school, was the complete opposite

Every kid in my class straight hated me, which to be honest I can't blame them for; I was (and on the inside still am) just the most annoying creature ever. I talked too much and too fast, was always trying to be funny (ultra cringe), hated sports, loved weird japanese cartoons, and was extremely sensitive; I'd get 0-100 worked up when people would tease me, but didn't have the heart (and genuinely didn't want) to say anything or fight back. So I'd just stew in it myself, then cry my eyes out in bed every night. It started from my first day of school, and after a few years the good grades and praise from adults didn't matter at all. I distinctly remember looking in the mirror one time in first grade, noticing that I was gaining weight, and thinking ""I'm ugly and I hate myself"". By 4th grade I had completely shut down; stopped doing all of my schoolwork, lying about homework. All I wanted to do was play video games,l. My dad, in response, locked me down to try and fix the problem; I could play video games for an hour a day, that was it. So at that point, life meant being happy for that hour and spending the rest of the day waiting for that hour, literally being unable to think or care about anything else. I gained more weight, got more awkward, and started being attracted to cool/edgy stuff (because I was the polar opposite of cool, and the biggest cupcake in the universe). Then my grandma died when I was 9, and I gradually started getting more quiet and less exited about things. 

Puberty, of course, was hell; this could be a full novel, but to sum it up I went from girl to girl, falling in love (or so I thought), not saying anything because I knew I never had a chance, becoming ""best friends"", caving and telling them how I felt, getting told I was loved like a brother, repeat. I was morbidly obese at this point, and had the worst self image ever. The one positive thing, though, was that at 12 I got into metal music. It was 100% me just trying to be cool, honestly the most pathetic thing ever, but it took hold and gave me my first actively creative outlet. I started playing bass at 16, because I thought I wasn't cool enough to be a guitarist. Now, however, I play guitar (half-lol)

(Another novel could be written about how my relationship with music, as a musician, affects my current emotional state, because it's a massive factor. it's too much to get into here though. suffice to say it's a big deal)

Anyway though, back to the important stuff. When I was 12 I started exhibiting volatile mood swings and outburts that I couldn't control, the next year I essentially got expelled from school (suspended for the 3rd time that year at the end of the year and being told I wasn't allowed to come back the following year). We moved, I started going to a public school (I had been going to a private catholic school up until then, because stepmom is catholic and we lived in a city with horrible public schools. This is why my ADHD was never noticed or addressed, because all of my teachers were middle aged women who only believed in laziness. It also should go without saying that I didn't believe in god, at all, which created lots of conflict). And then at 14, I started getting suiciadal. I was hospitalized, diagnosed with my bipolar disorder, and put on shit ton if antipsychotics.

The majority of high school, for that reason, is a complete blur. I failed every year, only passed because of summer school, and by my junior year I was barely even going anyway; I would just sleep all day. Stepmom would try to get me to get up and go, I wouldn't, she would call the police, they would threaten to take me to DH (county juvie) unless I got in the cop car with them and went to school, I'd go, sit in the bathroom for 20 minutes and then walk 4 miles right back home. I should, however, mention that I kind of had friends at this point; bad girl/first ""love""/object of obsession moved onto my street when I was 12, we became ""best friends"" (the first of many), and through her I met other ""bad kids""; all of whom I thought were WAY cooler than the kids who went to my school, who made fun of me all of the time but still went to church. 

Funnily enough though, they actually accepted me; they knew I was a complete ""poser"", that my parents weren't drug addicts, and that I forced my swear words. But I think they also knew I was an outcast, and in that sense I was genuine, I became the honorary fat joke of the group. However, I never really opened up to or connected to any of them; I never talked about how I read manga, certainly never opened up my emotions. I was more of a character to and around them, so I never felt much closeness. And then when we moved I lost pretty much all contact with them. I met some kind of similar people to them in high school, only one of whom I could call a real friend. Went to parties when I could, would drink as much as possible in a short period of time so I could be funny, was still the character around everyone. So point being, I still felt completely alone. 

The last specific event I'll talk about here is imo the absolute worst one; it's my most unpleasant memory, and I really feel like it sums me and my feelings about myself/the world in a nutshell.

Bad girl from old neighborhood and I had kept some contact through high school, I was still very much ""in love"". I had confessed that to her years earlier, so she knew, but obviously it wasn't reciprocated (again, my fault and not hers; I was repulsive. lol). We would also hang out sometimes too, and one time out of nowhere she started kissing me (first kiss). Then she told me we were going to have sex. So we did, kind of. And by that I mean it lasted for less than a minute because she had her eyes closed the entire time, intentionally. She looked so uncomfortable, so unhappy, I still get fucked up whenever I think about it. I already knew she wasn't doing it straight up out of desire, right from the start, but at that point I realized she was doing out
of pure pity. So I stopped, apologized, left, and we
pretty much stopped talking after that.

I'm gonna leave off there though. Things did a complete 180 after high school, so it's kind of lot lol. and idek if anyone is gonna read this, or want to hear more. if you do though, I'll be glad to share. and either way, if you got this far, thanks for reading. it means a lot"
bipolar,AllThreadsAreSafe,2020/3/7,"Struggles and Triumphs with Creativity and Hypomania So firstly, I¡¯m a creative writing major in college. It¡¯s always been a fine line for me balancing my mental health and creativity because I have most of my best ideas while hypomanic, and I am certainly the most prolific then. I withdrew from college in 2018 and transferred to start the school year of 2019, and I struggled with finding creativity while being stable. Fortunately I have a great team of doctors, therapists, and family members who have stuck with me through it all, and I¡¯m finally starting to put some pieces together. I¡¯m 10,000 words into my first draft of a novel I¡¯ve always been meaning to write and I couldn¡¯t be more proud. Just wanted to have some people to share that with who get it. 


Thank you all so much for the support I¡¯ve gotten as a lurker. Cheers!"
bipolar,mirrorwonderland,2020/1/7,"Graduate School - Stuck and Need Opinions/Advice Hey All - I spent the last year applying for and getting into grad school to become a school counselor. I picked this degree specifically because I love working with kids and due to my own long mental health journey, it¡¯s a natural career for me. (I¡¯ve been doing coaching, intervention, teaching, and mentoring with youth for a long time). 

I also find that the downtime with a school schedule is very helpful for my own mental health. I also like paying into PERA because the rewards in retirement are better than Social Security (you pay more and get more). I will say the insurance is abysmal and I can¡¯t afford to see my therapist now which really sucks. 

Here¡¯s the problem: today a situation came up that feels like that ¡®fool me twice¡¯ saying. This is the third school I¡¯ve worked at, and I¡¯ve found them all to have this issue of not supporting their staff and lacking procedures and policies. Today I got a real emotional slap in the face and it took all of my patience to not just quit. There have been other smaller red flags but today was a big one. 

In short, I am feeling like a school environment is actually potentially too unstable for my own mental health. Schools lack structure and consistency as leadership is always changing. This affects my goals and priories, and makes me feel unsupported. I wonder if I would be ¡®safer¡¯ in an environment that I have more control over, like in private practice. I don¡¯t know if that¡¯s even a true statement, but I imagine it¡¯s more controlled since it¡¯s not a school that¡¯s always in flux and chaos. 

The other large issue I am facing is that I was informed (only when I tried to add online classes) that this program doesn¡¯t allow any online classes. There was no reason for me to believe this during the application process. 

I recently also found out it is a lot easier to get an LPC and then add School Counseling if you want the flexibility of private or school jobs. (As opposed to doing it the other way around, specifically because the state is so short on school counselors they¡¯ve set up a program for LPCs). 

So here¡¯s my question: if you were me, a bipolar person who really has to put their own mental health first, would you throw away a grad school program that you¡¯re having doubts about and start the process over for an online program and start as an LPC? And then still pursue a school counseling license in the future if it seems like the right thing to do? 

I¡¯m am asking here because I know others will relate to not being able to trust your gut - I¡¯m always paranoid, I make rash decisions, and I can¡¯t always trust my brain to see things clearly. 

I also don¡¯t have anyone in my life that I can really bounce these thought off of, so I just wanted to see what the internet thinks."
bipolar,Amethystpony,2020/2/17,"Calling off of work I am always so nervous when I have to call in to work to take a day off because I am unwell mentally. Today will be the first time I've called off due to mental health reasons since I started my job in September. I never know what to say or how much information to give. The manager that originally hired me that knew about my bipolar no longer works for the company, and I have never even met my supervisors due to working 3rd shift which is unsupervised. It is stressing me out and making this day so much worse than it already is. I'm almost positive that I'm going to get written up for calling in and I'm willing to accept that, I just wish it were easier to explain to people that don't suffer from mental health issues."
bipolar,humstu,2020/1/13,"Bipolar misdiagnosis? I had a breakdown in college sophomore year. I went to my school's counseling center because I just suddenly thought that life had no meaning and that no matter what I would do, there wasn't going to be any point. The people at my school's counseling center sent me to the hospital right away because they thought I was suicidal. After staying at the hospital for three days (including a weekend, when I only got to meet with a doctor once every day)£¬ a group of doctors came in to observe me and later that day one of them told me that they thought I had bipolar. It's been three years and I no longer remember the details of the conversation. But they talked about how I was talking really fast and my questions towards the medications were organized. They had me seeing a psychiatrist in my school's counselling center, she said that I had bipolar and prescribed me medications. I never liked her. I always thought and still think that she was fake. The medications made me lose my sex drive (but I also didn't start having sex until sophomore year) and made me want to sleep all the time. I had thoughts that year. And I was depressed and very lost. In the summer, I started an internship and I did very well. I started to forget taking medications. At the end of the summer, I just threw all my meds away. 

I should add that; before I threw away my meds at the end of that summer, I was at a thanksgiving dinner with remote step-family members. My mom started a conversation with her husband's cousin, who was a psychiatrist; she successfully got that cousin to say that he thought bipolars were over-diagnosed. After my sophomore year, upon my school's psychiatrst's request, I met with a psychiatrist in my local hospital to ""check in."" I told him about my break down etc and he told me that my depression might be episodic. My school is ranked pretty high and it's known among the students that the school sends the students to the hospital when they ""seem to"" be very upset; every year, there are students killing themselves.

Now I've graduated from college and started a high-paying job. But I started to think whether I indeed had/have bipolar. It is true that sometime I get very excited and I can talk and think very fast (like within an hour I can come up with a project and think about many details relating to it). My friends and acquaintances have told me that sometimes I seemed very happy. I think I definitely get upset sometimes. I think sometimes I get very upset but I would ignore my emotions and try to fix them with hooking up with guys on Tinder. The way I respond to my emotions isn't normal. I also think that it's a fact that I put lots of stuff on my schedule after sophomore year (18 credits per semester + student orgs), so that I had no time to think about my existential stuff or to figure out whether I was sad or not. I realized that I also got very good at masking my thoughts and at interacting with people, including my friends, in a way that they couldn't see anything wrong with me (even negative emotions). I also don't hang out with friends that often. 

I've also been thinking recently whether I might have ASD. When I was a child, I couldn't read social cues and I would get abused by my ""best friend"" (emotionally and verbally) without realizing it. I was also very bad at reading comprehension (like the implications of metaphors in an article, the author's intention etc) until college. 

Sorry for the messy description of my situations. I think I might have bipolar, but it doesn't seem that I'm checking the boxes in a standard way. I'm high-functioning. My mood swings from time to time (probably more than I could notice) but usually within a day or even a few hours. I've been thinking about going to a doctor again to see if I have ASD or/and bipolar. But I also feel that I'm so good at masing my emotions now that honestly I myself have problem figuring out how I actually feel."

bipolar,golgigoat,2020/3/28,"Latuda max dose So I was on Latuda 40 to 60mg for a month and had to stop because I didn¡¯t have enough food during this pandemic to keep me from getting sick off of it. After my phone appointment with my doctor, she says I am extremely unwell and that she wants to up the dose to 160 right away and is thinking of even doing 180mg. I¡¯m not sure what to think about this, especially when access to food is so uncertain and when sick symptoms are something to be worried about right now. Personally I would like a medication I don¡¯t HAVE to eat with, but this is the one she has chosen for me. I¡¯m supposed to start at 80 in a week and then jump to 120 two weeks after that as my doctor is extremely worried about psychosis(I¡¯ve been down this road quite a few times and right now there is no hospital psychiatric priority with covid 19). I¡¯m nervous to take it because I am nervous for that sick feeling it gives me. It also wasn¡¯t doing enough at 60mg so I¡¯m not sure what 160mg would look like.

bipolar,iphany,2020/1/30,"Hypo progress I seem to have two ¡°big¡± hypo to depressive episodes a year. This last one I saw coming because I got suddenly and completely obsessed with fountain pens and ink and bought many hundreds of dollars worth online over the course of a day or two. So A few days ago when I had an intense conversation with someone about spirituality and left making plans to start my own religion, I stopped myself mid-google (how to get religious tax exemption) (five acre properties for sale in my area) (how many tiny houses will fit on five acres) (is it legal to live off the grid in my area) (how to start a religious charter school) I called my psych and said ¡°so, just wanted to let you know I¡¯m about to start my own religion and I thought that seemed like a significant thing to tell you¡±.


She was very proud (of the call, not the religion. Nobody seemed to be impressed with the notion of a religion that combines Christianity, Buddhism, quantum mechanics and witchcraft)

There is not a day that goes by where my feet don¡¯t drag. I am literally braindead exhausted. I also take extended release Concerta for ADD, and to combat the exhaustion of Latuda, my psychiatrist put me on Ritalin 10mg. 

However, a Ritalin boost in the morning only works occasionally. 

On top of being extremely tired, I feel the Latuda makes me feel off, or uncomfortable. To a point where I wish I could feel nothing, instead. 

Anyway, if anybody has taken Latuda and found a solution to this, or found a medication that worked better, please share your experience. Thanks :)"
bipolar,aduncecapforjunior,2020/2/6,"do I have brain damage? what happened to my mind? I'm a 22 year old college student with bipolar 1. I left school February 2019 when had my first psychotic episode of mania and had to be institutionalized. After a few days of thrashing around and screaming(between ativan injections) I suddenly snapped out of it. My thought process was fuzzy for about a week, but then I seemed to return to normal. I went home and relaxed for a couple weeks before going back to school to visit my friends at school and to inquire into the process of re-enrollment. The moment I returned to campus paranoid thoughts materialized, and I spiraled into another manic episode. This time I didn't return to normal.

I saw a psychiatrist who increased my medication(which at this time was 20mg olanzapine with no mood stabilizer) and couple of weeks went by. The paranoia quickly abated, but I didn't snap back into my normal state. I found it difficult to think about anything outside my immediate physical surroundings and discovered I couldn't read. Speaking had become very difficult. I also lost my ability to draw(which has always been my biggest passion) as if the muscle memory had dissolved or something. I went to a treatment center for a few months, and gradually regained the ability to speak in complete sentences, but everything else remained totally impaired. After a few med changes, I got put on Vraylar 3mg(which I hear is a great antispsychotic with almost no side effects), and 100mg Lamictal. Months went by and I still couldn't draw, and could barely read and for this latter reason didn't return to school in the fall. My psychiatrist said that recovery from psychosis can take a long time, but none of the people I met in treatment experienced this kind of general impairment of all mental faculties.

This past November I decided that even if I wasn't fully present mentally(or even 75% present mentally), that I would benefit from returning to school by being with my friends and experiencing the healthy stressors of a reduced academic course load. I got re-enrolled and returned to school this January, but being barely able to read has made things very, very difficult and frustrating. At home this past year I'd found a rhythm of behavior in which I was able to accept myself and stay present in the moment, and I'm working to establish something like that here at college, but it's tough. I think a big part of why I was able to accept myself this past year was because I believed I was going to return to normal, to regain my ability to think, speak, write, and draw. Now I'm not so sure. I've only experienced progress in the speaking department. My thoughts don't flow. I can't remember the previous sentence in the book I'm reading. I can't think about anything in depth. I can't keep up with the speed of dialogue in movies. I can't draw like I used to(the activity feels pretty foreign to me even though I've been drawing almost every day this past year). What's going on? I'm starting to really wonder if this is what the rest of my life is going to be like. I'm really grateful for my friends and my family, and getting to go to college, but this is just unbearable.

Is this brain damage? Is this just what bipolar one is like?

Has anyone else experienced this slow agonizing recovery from psychosis/mania?

Have you recovered? How long did it take?

bipolar,papashalashanki,2020/1/25,"Anyone else with difficult parents? Title makes me seem like a teenager. I'm 23 but temporarily living at home while I move out for good.

One reason is that my mom has never been understanding and actually an attributing factor to my recently diagnosed condition.

This is partially ranting partially seeking advice. Through my whole life I was yelled at and beaten for having acted erratically because it's ""all me and my shitty personality"" (I'm a first gen American with parents from former Yugoslavia, those people do NOT recognize mental health at all) and naturally that made me feel horrible for being myself.

Got diagnosed a few days ago and while it was pretty quickly issued, I easily accepted it because it's fairly obvious. Now that it's official my mother has changed her tune from ""doesn't exist it's all you"" to ""you're batshit insane"" and invalidating any concern of mine. And yelling at me still of course.

Any advice on how to handle this situation until I leave? Kinda eats me alive especially with how unstable I've been these days."

bipolar,artcatswhiskey,2020/1/8,"Missing Side Effects I was thinking last night, while taking my 250 dose of seroquel along with my 400 lamictal, that I haven't had any of the side effects of seroquel. It's been a few months, and while it helps me sleep (and helps with my mood, so says the doc), I don't feel groggy in the morning. Maybe I'm sleeping in 30/45 minutes more than I used to, but it's not sleeping through the afternoon, like some people say. Also, I've lost weight. Don't hate me. But I haven't had any cravings or desire to eat. 

The point of me sharing this is that it makes me nervous that the medicine isn't working properly, or as well as it could/should be. Yes, it makes me fall asleep, which I desperately need. Sure, the doc says my mood is more stable (although still not where is 'should' be, per him). But maybe it could be doing more?

Now that I'm detoxing from alcohol (taking Naltrexone and Valium to deal with that), I'm re-aware of medicine-related side effects. It's like I've been taking lamictal for so, so long that I forgot at one point it really fogged me up; that side effect has just become part of who I am now. So the lack of the highly lamented seroquel side effects has just peaked my concern.

Anyway, would love to hear if anyone else hasn't had the commonly-described side effects of their medications."

Not sure if this is the right place to give it a go but I'll try here.

I have been with a girl (on and off) for 5 months and its been great 90% of the time. However, the 10% has been hell and everyone I describe it to guesses that she might have a personality disorder. So, I've googled the symptons of bipolar and it all fits: Dysfunctional childhood / family life and abuse, depression with self-harm and struggled to leave house for a whole month at one point and the random bursts of energy and spontanous ideas at 3am etc. that I didn't understand before are explained quite neatly by mania. 

Anyway, the main problem for me is that everything will be going well in our relationship and then all of a sudden I will do something small and she will overreact massively and be quite cruel, which is something that she would never do normally. She also refuses to ever admit she is wrong and I genuinely thinks I'm trying to manipulate her when I tell her that she just went off the rails for half an hour and I don't know what to do. She doesn't realise she has a problem, has a victim complex and gets in moods where whatever I say is wrong. I really feel if I tell her that she could probably do with some therapy that that would be it for us, and I don't want that because I love her. But her behaviour is really clawing away at my mental health and self-esteem.

I've been on it for about five days now and between the nausea and restlessness it renders me nigh-nonfunctional, completely so in the evenings after I take it with dinner.

bipolar,hamboneZA,2020/1/30,"Why Mac Miller's ""Good News"" nailed a bipolar existence ... according to me.

[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIHF7u9Wwiw**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIHF7u9Wwiw)

It¡¯s clear the lyrics are multifarious, and fascinating. Alex has a keen eye for lyrics that speak sense, brilliant song and I can identify with it a lot. This is obviously my own interpretation (apologies for the pronoun switches):

The subject is suffering severe anxiety and is wrestling with guilt for past mistakes and compounding angst is a fear of making mistakes in future.   


&gt;I spent a whole day in my head  
&gt;  
&gt;Do a little spring cleaning  
&gt;  
&gt;I¡¯m always too busy dreaming, well  
&gt;  
&gt;Maybe I should wake up instead

Here the frustration is that the subject has persistent feelings of inadequacy on the one hand, and a drive to be the best at something, or everything.

Having ambition is for the most part a positive trait but it can become all consuming insofar as the desire to outperform inevitably leads to a plethora of half-finished projects, endless lists of tasks not yet started. With these comes a swath of guilt and despair once the reality hits that one cannot possibly be all things to all people and, considering that these ambitions were dreamed up by the subject themselves, the self-loathing becomes the proverbial albatross around ones neck further compounding the ability to perform.  


&gt;A lot of things I regret, but I just say I forget  
&gt;  
&gt;Why can't it just be easy?  
&gt;  
&gt;Why does everybody need me to stay?  
&gt;  
&gt;Oh I hate the feeling

This is classic post-manic guilt, at least that¡¯s how it applies to me. When I¡¯m feeling ¡®up¡¯ it¡¯s as if people cannot keep pace with me and my ambitions. If I¡¯m particularly manic the inability people have to keep up with me becomes frustrating and ultimately triggers nasty, sarcastic and judgmental aspersions on the offending parties character. It is only once the mind returns to ¡®normal¡¯ do I realize that my expectations of people were unrealistic and that how I expressed my frustration at the time was offensive and totally out of character for an otherwise pleasant, positive person that has a positive contribution to make to a group of friends, at the workplace or to society generally that everyone ¡®needs \[them\] to stay¡¯.  


&gt;Got the cards in my hand I hate dealing, yeah  
&gt;  
&gt;Get everything I need then I¡¯m gone  
&gt;  
&gt;But it ain't stealing  
&gt;  
&gt;Can I get a break?

Here the subject has worked hard to get to a place where they¡¯re comfortable with who they are and where they are in life, with everything they need to succeed ¨C that is legitimately earned rather than manipulated or coaxed from others. The cards are a creeping anxiety that being in control at a point in time inevitably means a fall into a dark space is inevitable, especially when the only person to blame when things go wrong is their own. Can I get a break? No¡­  


&gt;I wish that I could just get out my god damn way  
&gt;  
&gt;What is there to say?  
&gt;  
&gt;There ain¡¯t no better time than today

¡­ the self loathing is relentless, the guilt all consuming and leaves nothing that can be said to the people left in the wake. Now the pre-chorus links the last line of this verse ¨C a clever switch from feeling positive and up beat to justifying reasons to lie in bed to wrestle the black dog.  


&gt;Well, maybe I¡¯ll lay down for a little  
&gt;  
&gt;Instead of always tryin¡¯ to figure everything out  
&gt;  
&gt;And all I do is say sorry  
&gt;  
&gt;Half the time I don¡¯t even know what I'm saying it about

Now we¡¯re back in a slump and overthinking why it all went awry. Again the theme of guilt for actions past surfaces and, importantly, that even when apologizing one has no idea of the extent of their poor behavior and in some cases cannot remember what exactly they did to offend while on the ¡®up¡¯ train. This happens a lot in post-manic episodes: apologizing generally because self-awareness dictates you¡¯ve caused harm and it needs to rectified, but fail to truly ?apologize because of a failure to recall ones actions during a manic episode.  


&gt;Good news, good news, good news, that's all they wanna hear  
&gt;  
&gt;No, they don¡¯t like it when I'm down  
&gt;  
&gt;But when I'm flying know it make ¡®em so uncomfortable, so different  
&gt;  
&gt;What's the difference?

This is articulates with mind blowing accuracy the labyrinth that is a bipolar existence. On the one hand there¡¯s pressure to ¡®fit in¡¯ and project a successful, ambitious person by singing from the rooftops that you¡¯ve got it all figured out (you don¡¯t ¨C quit lying to yourself). And when they¡¯re not misrepresenting the truth, they¡¯re avoiding life entirely in a depression that grips so severely it¡¯s suffocating. Then imagine the frustration that ensues once the black dog has lifted and you¡¯re flying again, doing great things, being everyone for all people and it¡¯s rejected by the very people you feel you need to appease and make proud. What¡¯s the difference? None ¨C either way you¡¯re a disappointment to yourself and everyone you hold dear.  


&gt;When it ain¡¯t that bad  
&gt;  
&gt;It could always be worse  
&gt;  
&gt;I¡¯m runnin¡¯ out of gas, hardly anything left  
&gt;  
&gt;Hope I make it home from work, well

This bridge is the space between the ¡®up¡¯ and the down. It¡¯s repeated throughout the song between the poles. The words are flat, boring even. Often that¡¯s what it feels like to be sit with regular people, doing ordinary things (like go to work and commuting). It¡¯s dead boring, BUT it¡¯s also a place where you¡¯re waiting for the next mood shift, but apprehensive too about what this next ride will bring with it.  


&gt;So tired of being so tired  
&gt;  
&gt;Why I gotta build somethin¡¯ beautiful just to go set it on fire?  
&gt;  
&gt;I¡¯m no liar but, sometimes the truth don¡¯t sound like the truth,  
&gt;  
&gt;Maybe cause it ain't, I just love the way it sounds when I say it

This mental gymnastics is exhausting, from overthinking problems to navigating how to make amends with the people you¡¯ve scorned or distanced yourself from in times of depression. The rhetoric is telling of a self-awareness that there is a problem ¨C that all the effort it takes to build friendships, a career, a business, a life you and your kin can be proud of only to decimate it all in one fell swoop. The truth often doesn¡¯t sound like the truth because misrepresenting the facts to oneself is a mechanism of self-preservation. Admitting failure of one¡¯s own doing would be too much to fathom.  


&gt;Its what I do, if you know me it ain't anything new  
&gt;  
&gt;Wake up to the moon, haven't seen the sun in a while  
&gt;  
&gt;But I heard that the sky is still blue

What is true, and I¡¯ve only recently learned this, is that people care immensely and many are sensitized to the cycles, some without even knowing it. Building a healthy ecosystem and then unwittingly destroying it is standard procedure. Knowing that inevitably the good times will end again leads to being bedridden, unable to move seeking refuge under the blankets and waking up when the sun goes down and staying up until it rises wrecked with anxiety about what the next day will hold, there¡¯s a rumor that things will get better.  


&gt;Heard they don't talk about me too much, no more  
&gt;  
&gt;That's the problem with a closed door

The consequences of alienating oneself from relationships, friendships and kinship again come-to-the-fore. People move on, their priorities shift and their loyalties wane. It¡¯s not necessarily these people¡¯s fault though ¨C there are only so many times a person will reach out to help and have their hand bitten. Here comes the kicker:  


&gt;There's a whole lot more waiting on the other side  
&gt;  
&gt;I¡¯m always wondering if it feel like summer  
&gt;  
&gt;I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time

When life isn¡¯t going a certain kind of way, the creeping ¡°what-if¡± I rebooted the system and opt-ed out for now. At its least severe this may simply be a hibernation into obscurity while things cool down after the inferno created while on a ¡®high¡¯ and at worst amounts to suicidal ideation. The latter doesn¡¯t necessarily translate into actioning the ideation and, in my case, remains a ¡®what-if¡¯ scenario. It¡¯s still a pretty scary place to be once you realize you¡¯re in it.  


&gt;Then I finally discover  
&gt;  
&gt;That it ain¡¯t that bad  
&gt;  
&gt;Ain't so bad  
&gt;  
&gt;When it ain't that bad

We¡¯re find ourselves out of the scary space of the previous verse. Quite why one can never really tell. Did circumstances change so much while you were wrapped up in what-ifs? Possibly. It could also be that time has healed the wounds that were inflicted on the people who once loved you. Whatever the reason, we take it by the horns and return to the placid, boring place that is real life between the poles.  


&gt;Please don't gotta be no more  
&gt;  
&gt;No more, no more, no more, no more  
&gt;  
&gt;No more, no more, no more, no more  
&gt;  
&gt;Yeah

\-ENDS-

Sorry-not-sorry for the long read. This song speaks mostly to the depressive state, but clearly the mania feeds off a desire to spring into action after a depression and bring people ¡°good news¡± ¨C the title of the song.

I am 49 years old, bipolar 2 with hyperthymic temperament. I have been on lamotrigine 150 mg for a couple of years. Recently I went to the gyn (hot flashes, pain with intercourse) and blood tests said I am postmenopausal. So he sent some hormones. Then I read on the prospect that  these hormones (which are contraceptives, only that I have to always take the active ones and throw away the inactive week of pills) interact with lamotrigine. Taking these hormones take lamotrigine levels down. So my pshychiatrist adjusted it to 200 mg.

Just wanted to share this for all my fellow BD menopausal women out there, or women in general because one day menopause arrives.

By the way, the hormones worked to eliminate the hot flashes. And intercourse pain was eliminated by a vaginal cream of estradiol, applied twice a week."

I've been discussing adding an antidepressant to my mood stabilizer with my doctor for awhile now, and plan to ask him about it on my coming appointment the 13th. I guess the issue is I'm literally doing nothing, my Dad is continually getting upset with me and trying to encourage me to go do something, anything really, and nothing sounds appealing. Even getting out of bed is an issue. At this point it's been about 3 years since I've had a job, and I failed out of classes last semester. College isn't really an option anymore.

When my head is clear I can see my actions and have so much regret. 

It's so hard to find friends who truly accept you, including your actions when you're manic or depressed or in a crisis.

bipolar,Riizu,2020/1/29,"Seeking Advice on Seroquel (~1/2mo in) Hey, /r/bipolar - first time poster.

I'm currently 27. For the last ~9 years or so, I've fought depression and anxiety. It predominantly cropped up in college, and eventually I sought help after coming close to committing suicide (a couple steps away from trying to figure out the fastest way to a roof).

Since then, my mental health battle has been very up and down. I struggled with depression for awhile, but seemed to get better after being on a med for a period of time (the name escapes me, but I want to say it was generic Prozac). About a year after that I had an incredibly difficult break up, which from what I can remember, seems to be the beginning of my anxiety. Major panic attacks, generally feeling out of control, etc. The worst episodes would leave me almost catatonic on the floor, feeling like I was five years old again. I remember having my meds swapped due to increased likelihood of anxiety with whatever I was on, and things in general seemed to get better, but life was also on an upswing. I eventually committed the iconic sin of just stopping my meds, but I seemed to be okay.

Fast forward to now, and I've currently been actively struggling for about the last two years. During that time, I've had a number of major life events, but predominantly getting engaged and dealing with an extremely bad employer. I'm now with a fantastic employer, but in general, the mental health side hasn't, ""kept up"" if that makes sense. The reason I mention it, is that for the most part I objectively feel like I have a positive life. I've got a fantastic support system, my new job is great, and lately, I feel like I'm more of the problem than anything else.

Seeking help to try and manage that and reduce the number of depressive episodes, I went back to a local doc, and started a train of 3-4 medications. Again, awful with names, but I think the most recent were Sertraline and Viibyrd, with my last Viibyrd dose being in July. I barely made it a week through that, as it seemed to cause even more anger and terrifying night terrors. I finally made the time to see my doc again and try and get back up on the proverbial horse December 2019. At that point, my doctor suggested I try a bipolar medication for my mood swings and major depressive episodes, swapped me to Seroquel XR 300mg, as well as had me try out Ajovy for migraines (something I had been dealing with for about the last year and a half). I initially started my dose at 50mg for 2 days, 150mg for another 2 days, and then the full 300.

Overall, the experience has been mixed. Unlike other anti-depressants/anti-anxiety medications, I don't have any of the traditional side effects. I've avoided the horrendous GI problems, my headaches have been mild, etc. On the other hand, my mood has felt altered far more than it has in the past. I generally feel like im in a bit of a ""haze."" Sometimes its hard to structure my thoughts, and overall life feels like its moving by me. Furthermore, the drowsiness is some of the worst I've ever experienced. I've had days that I wake up after 10hrs of sleep and still can't function until I've taken a nap, even if its a couple hours later. This has made work difficult as I have more off days than not, and in general, I find myself extremely scared. I feel like I have no idea whats happening to me. It almost feels like i'm losing myself. When I get started on a new task (such as writing this post), it seems to go away, but finding the energy to do tasks tends to be difficult.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? I'm not formally diagnosed bipolar, but my doctor has suggested it could be it, and in general my doctor seems to be at a bit of a loss for what I might need. I think they are most likely correct, but im not sure im pursuing the best treatment option. I am actively looking for a psychiatrist rather than a GP, but between work and the above feelings, its taking longer than I want to admit.

(Apologies if that was too much of a ramble, also something im noticing I do more and more lately)"
bipolar,drippingingoldd,2020/1/5,"Why do we do this to ourselves? Ranting.. I always end up not refilling my prescription. Things go well for a week or two, but I never go too long before the dread starts to sink in bit by bit. The absolute fucking dread of going to work, dealing with people, trying to still create a future for myself, shit I did while manic, it all slowly dials up in intensity; hardly noticeable at first, but grows into something unbearable and entirely consuming. Irritation and rage soon follows dread, sometimes it just tags along from the get go. I realize I'm snapping at everyone and my patience has worn incredibly thin, I can't stand to be around anyone. The pit in my stomach at this point threatens to collapse inward and become a black hole. Everything becomes too much. This hatred of the world morphs into self hatred and suicidality. The negative self talk becomes rampant, I can't stand the person I've become and the future feels very bleak. The intrusive thoughts of things I want to do to myself are the most unnerving part. Thankfully I have alcohol, cannabis, and Klonopin to quell me while I wait out the storm. 

Why do we do this to ourselves? Why am I so resistant to medication/help? I get on a really good track of attending therapy and taking meds, but I inevitably decide to hell with it and end up in this situation. 

Tldr: crybaby ranting about medication non-compliance and its (shitty) effects"
bipolar,tj744,2020/1/25,"Inquiry at the end of my unorganized summary of emotions My doctor recently referred me to a mental health specialist but after originally diagnosing me with depression I'm not confident in her diagnosis this time. I had a really bad episode, lied to my wife and decided to drink and I stole someone's xanax. After crashing the car and realizing what I could have done to someone I crawled to the center of the road in the middle of the night and the last thing I remember is peace of mind thinking I was finally going to lay to rest. My childhood wasn't awful. I dealt with an abusive father who struggle with addiction. Tonight I had an epiphany and my years of anger toward him I finally could relate. I realize he struggled with addiction because it made him feel the emotions he was seeking and avoiding his depression or whatever he was feeling. I'm not saying that's the way to handle emotions but I can understand now that he didn't love drugs or alcohol more than me and most of his emotions were intensified by his disorder. It saddens me to think of the emotional torment he must've been going through. 

Precursor: I am not trying to self diagnose

Thinking back on my life if I were to be diagnosed with bipolar it would make sense. Moments I can think of that imitate mania are times where I had the energy to go out with friends but the alcohol amplified my already intense emotions and turned me into either irrationally angry or sloppily sad and in result I would get into fights to push those emotions away with the adrenaline high. If there was anything that I can look at as a trigger for me it would be when someone challenges my opinion. It makes me feel this false sense of a challenge. It feels so real that I can twist their words and make myself feel like they're out to get me. It feels like a personal attack with something so simple and I say some unspeakable things. Afterwards it's a vicious cycle of self loathing because I said something so horrible to someone that I was dear to me. Then what would be considered the times of depression I think about how I'm slowly pushing them away from me and make myself feel so insecure that I withdraw. There's a lot of examples in my life where I can relate to a simple google search but I think google could almost diagnose you with anything if you try and relate hard enough. After a very traumatic event I think back and I have never felt the same. I have these bipolar tendencies almost like it triggered something that was there. I don't even remember what it's like to feel happy. It's so hard for me to think how now I find myself so bitter and depressed. I'm not suicidal as often as I was before but the world feels grey and I find myself trying to be numb to emotion because it's better than months of depression. Happiness feels to me like a moment in time rather than emotion. Almost like it's there for a split second and I didn't really get to feel it as an emotion. Is it possible that this very traumatic event triggered my bipolar disorder? Or am I just relating to google?

TL;DR is it possible that a traumatic event can trigger bipolar disorder?"
bipolar,zevondhen,2020/4/16,"Has Anyone Else Ever Experienced This? (Please excuse the length and disorganized nature of this post--it's a bit difficult for me to articulate myself at the moment) I was diagnosed with bipolar type II when I was 18 (although I was 15 when I first displayed symptoms) and I have brief hypomanic episodes followed by long stretches of depressed episodes, but I also experience another aspect that I've never heard anyone ever talk about. 

I've never been able to really describe it, but I suppose it's sort of like the feeling you get smelling your favorite perfume or tasting the best food or being a kid on Christmas morning but about *everything*. All sensory information. All the time. It's this overwhelming euphoric sense that quickly peaks within a day or two and then takes a sharp dive into being overwhelming (think a wire with far too much current running through it) and this sensation can linger for *years*. It might not sound all that bad, but it's mostly because I lack the ability to fully describe it. I've experienced suicidal episodes, panic attacks, intense grief after losing a sister to suicide, and PTSD flashbacks and this... ordeal is up there with the worst mental states I've ever been in.

One vivid example I can think of is when I visited a house where the living room was entirely mustard yellow--the tablecloth was yellow, the drapery was yellow, the carpet was yellow, even the bricks in the fireplace were yellow. I felt extremely uncomfortable and it was like having to smell the mustiest, most cloying old lady perfume through a dirty dish rag (I didn't literally *smell* this, but it's the closest I can get to explaining how it felt). 

It also seems to be triggered by the transition from winter to spring and summer to fall and I suppose it might have something to do with a subconscious reaction to sensory input. It's so sensitive that one day in late February to early March I will walk outside, stop, and think ""yep, spring is coming."" 

Now I know a sense of mania/hypomania can include feelings of euphoria, but I haven't seen anyone describe anything quite like this. I'm sure with seven billion people on the planet I can't possibly be the only person with this issue but I've never read any literature, seen any media, or read any posts about anything similar. I have had psychiatrists say that they don't know what's going on in my brain or what to do about it. I don't even have the *language* to fully capture it and I feel terribly alone in a state that can be absolutely debilitating.

I just want to know if this sounds familiar to *anyone* out there because if I could find just one person who understands, it would help."

I'm tempted to get off of meds but I don't want to pull a textbook bipolar move that will risk me going into an episode when my test comes around without making an informed decision first. So back to my question - have any of y'all taken the LSAT, and if so what was your experience? How did your medication (or lack thereof) affect your performance? Any advice is pretty helpful at this point, so even if you know anecdotes from others please feel free to share. Thanks :)

bipolar,herozero13,2020/2/25,"Migraines and Mood Swings This may be a well covered thing, but I notice that when I get migraines (which is often if I'm not taking my inject-able medication) then it is inevitably accompanied by a downward (depressed) mood swing. It usually comes with agitation, and not just from the pain. This includes the inability to find anything that makes me happy, so I just sort of sit around doing something I don't really want to do while I'm in pain. Anyone else get this wonderful combo?"

bipolar,anonymous-confused,2020/3/5,"I can¡¯t tell if I¡¯m having a hypomanic episode or if my meds and therapy are working well? 
I have a diagnosis of clinical depression and anxiety but due to past behavior my therapist mentioned the possibility of bipolar II. As of now I do not have a definitive diagnosis because for the last several months (since seeing this therapist) I was in a very severe depressive state. 

I realized this week how how incredibly different I feel compared to even a few weeks ago. I used to sleep upwards of 16 hours a day, had great difficulty getting out of bed, missed classes, ate too much, constantly tired and groggy and avoided pretty much everyone. Now I¡¯m sleeping about 3-6 hours a night and I feel great, I¡¯ve been going to class, working out, hanging out with friends, doing projects in my apartment, working ahead in my classes - it¡¯s just bizarre how great I feel. 

I know I need to speak to my therapist about this but I don¡¯t have an appointment for a couple weeks. I¡¯m wondering if this is behavior I should be worried about or if this is just a good sign that my new medications are working well? I¡¯m not doing anything self destructive or dangerous (although I have in the past - drug abuse, hanging out with strangers etc), and I don¡¯t feel out of control but I¡¯m worried that I could be heading in a bad direction an not realize it?

bipolar,LittleWanderer123,2020/4/9,"Derealisation? World not real I suffer from bipolar 2, and have been mostly stable and well since starting lamotrigine about 7 years ago. With the stress of the Coronavirus lockdown, the threat of losing my job and lack of sleep from having a baby I started to teeter towards not being ok again, and self-harmed for the first time in years. 

I'm under a perinatal mental health team and they acted quickly to stop a relapse, adding quetiapine to help me sleep and sort out jumbled thoughts.

Problem is I still feel like nothing is real. Not like when you're depressed and everything feels far away,  but actually that the world isn't real at all. My husband is concerned by this thinking, but it feels rational to me.

Is this the start of psychosis/delusion? Or an anxious reaction to events? I fully believe it and am only questioning because of my husband's concern. The quetiapine is not making it go away. Has anyone else had this?"
bipolar,boolean_10,2020/3/10,"Mood Tracking With Python (Link Inside) [Crossposted from /r/Bipolar2]  Github link: [https://github.com/km2938/MoodTracker](https://github.com/km2938/MoodTracker)

Screenshots of the app and the graph are included in the Readme section when you click the link, just scroll down. The Readme section gives a brief discussion of the features but the pictures show most everything you will want to know. Currently it is designed for Bipolar II but it can be reworked for Bipolar I fairly easily. 

Hey everyone. I posted about a week ago with some code for a mood tracker. I have recently added the GUI and some new features. It works well but I haven't created an .exe file or anything yet. I will begin working on that when I have some more time. I am hoping to make it more easily customizeable in the future.

If you want to use the app:

The dependencies are listed in the README section. Once you have those, edit the filenames in the source code and the rest should work! I use miniconda for python and installed them that way but I think everything can be pip installed. Currently the create report function just uses print so it still needs to be used in a terminal for that to work. Eventually I will have it write to a file but I want to experiment more with the function before I do that. It is new to me as well.

This will always be kept free as it is meant to be helpful to this community. If you have any questions let me know and I will get to them when I can.

Special thanks to:

[/u/jonbearab](https://www.reddit.com/u/jonbearab/) and [/u/MikeTheWatchGuy](https://www.reddit.com/u/MikeTheWatchGuy/) for getting me to post the code and linking the gui wrapper I used, respectively. The motivation was helpful.

Edit1:

Updated some spelling errors in the symptoms portion of the survey and cleaned up the readme file a bit. Cross posted to [r/bipolarreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolarreddit/) in case it isn't seen here.

The reasoning behind the mood state question only having euthymic (normal) and depressed is as follows: Hypo is really difficult to notice in the moment and I think using an algorithm to identify hypo in a custom application such as this will eventually be more accurate (hopefully)."

All of my previous encounters with medical professional, whether short or long standing expressed they felt my emotional dysregulation was trauma related and not bipolar. 

Now after moving and two years of being on a meds cocktail that worked, I hit another emotional slump. I went to see a new psych and after 5 min of talking to me and one random sheet of paper he diagnoses me with bipolar ii. I politely disagree and he goes on to explain that all 7 previous professionals have misdiagnosed me and as he has 30 years in the field he knows bipolar when he sees it and he sees I have scored 7 out of some arbitrary number on this arbitrary test. He puts me on latuda. I go with it for a little while bc I'm not good at sticking up for myself. The latuda gave horrible side effects and made it feel like I was manic for two straight weeks, a feeling I've not felt before. I bring up my complaints, he switches me to another bipolar medication, and same thing happens. 

Now he wants to put me on lithium and its freaking me out. I don't know if I agree with the diagnosis or if I just have some irrational fear of bipolar/lithium. How do I know I'm truly bipolar? Is there any difference between high anxiety and mania? Should I continue listening to this psych or should I get a second opinion? How do I even stand up for myself to get a second opinion?

My father where often furious and didn't now how to handle me so it turned into anger, fights, arguments and called me lazy, alcoholic, and drug user and did not support anything I did but I understand him cause I didn't even know what where bwrong with me.i often drank alot when the mania started to end and I wanted to get that buzz again and keep on flying.
I will keep it short.

Even talking in discord with my friends is daunting and tiring, which I normally enjoy! But not right now since I feel so mentally slow and just like a boring ass conversationalist. Getting work done has been nearly impossible this past week. I've hardly gotten anything done. I'm super anxious again, over-run with self-doubt, especially at night.

It induced this rapid personality change that developed into a manic and numbed, dulled, emotionless state that lasted several months until I stopped taking the SNRI. I did alot of harm during that period that I am still paying for and will likely be paying for, very long term (divorce, bankruptcy).

I used to be able to talk to God, Angels or Philosophical figures like Kant, Voltaire, Camus or Nietzche like they were actually here. 

I felt like i could see the future where i've seen myself as the King of a zombie army. 
I lived that future and thought i was that Zombie king the day i took some MDMA in a rave party  were all i could see were zombies (The Walking Dead style) dancing to techno music (in reality it was just people under the influence of drugs and alcohol). Was a great party though 

I used to believe i was Rodion Raskolnikov, Don Quichotte or even Jesus. 

One time, i spent a whole night at a rave party not being able to recognize my best friends, like they became complete strangers all of the sudden. 

One night, i thought my loved ones were all dead and couldn't believe that that was actually not thrue, that one burned my heart pretty hard. 

One day i saw the sky turned into a rain of tears and blood and thought it was the end for everyone, don't know why but i  couldn't do anything but laught and took it like it was the best thing that could ever happen. 

Oh and i used to talk to objects, a lot, like they were actual living beings too. 

That some of what i can remember rn, i've been using for 4 years so i'm sure most of it has been forgotten. 

Being a heavy user ( mostly to overcome depression or simply to feel more manic when in a manic state because in those moment it always feels like a fucking great idea to try going even higher ) , those kind of stuff happened often and made it difficult to have a normal social and love life, as well as to follow my  college studies like i should.

bipolar,temeraria,2020/3/20,"I'm afraid of falling asleep Hello! BP1 here.

I am actively terrified of falling asleep. I can only go to sleep when I feel absolutely destroyed which is around 2 am. I have to sleep with lights on and sounds. If someone can sleep next to me, all the better. I am terrified of losing consciousness and never waking up. This started because of Seroquel. I took that fucking horrible thing for 5 months (three years ago) and it gave me rapid heartbeat plus the exquisite sensation that I had just received an intravenous shot of anesthesia that I couldn't fight. Falling asleep against your will while your heart is racing is not a nice way to sleep.

I stopped the medication when I started to get panic attacks and couldn't stop crying because I was so terrified of the side effects. I haven't been able to find a good mix of medication since 2017. I am so tired. Lamictal fucked up my memory. Risperidal is destroying my liver. Once I realized that my fear of my medication wasn't just in my head, but there was actual biological evidence to it, I worsened. I used to fall asleep slightly uncomfortable, now I literally sit up with my heart racing because I am petrified of losing control over my body.

I've developed a Panic Disorder because I am so terrified of my medication's side effects. I genuinely believe the medication is no longer working and it's slowly killing me or making my life worse.

The beautiful irony is that my delusions are worsening because I am not on the correct antipsychotic dose, but we've tried different meds and the side effects always beats the benefits. I'm trying to rationally face my fears, but the sensation of being unable to breathe and terrifying chest pain is horrible. I've always been an anxious person but this is straight out misery. My psych tried to give me klonopin and Lyrica but it worsens my symptoms and makes me more anxious - isn't that fantastic?

TL;DR: I developed a panic disorder from my meds side effects and now I can't sleep. Anxiety medication makes me more anxious because I truly believe (and have seen the evidence) that my body cannot withstand psychiatric medication."

bipolar,Penelope-Morgan,2020/3/10,"Need to get some thoughts out about my diagnosis. Hey all! I'm new to this subreddit. After being diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder type 1 today, I decided to check it out :)

My sister mentioned that I might be in denial about my mood symptoms, which prompted me to mention it to my psychiatrist. I got sober in 2011 - I would drink and sleep with multiple partners, do drugs, and meet random people from online in their homes. My family wouldn't know where I was for days at a time. I was diagnosed with bipolar at this time but attributed the behavior to my addiction.

I've had long periods of depression throughout my life, even after I got sober. Weeks/months of excessive sleeping, hopelessness; major fatigue, etc. etc. I attributed this to... just depression or possibly my complex trauma history. 

I've also had periods of high energy, elevated mood, impulsivity, racing thoughts, and goal-oriented behavior, talkativeness, talking fast while not making much sense. My decision-making during these periods is *not good*. Risky sexual behaviour (before I met my husband), getting on planes to meet internet friends alone across the country, hyperfocus on irrelevant things (such as politics), wanting to buy a house, have children *right now*. My work life has suffered because, for instance, I'm searching for houses online to buy rather than working when buying a home isn't a good idea in the first place. I took out $18,000 in student loans and didn't manage it correctly. Afterwards I attributed these behaviors to being, quite frankly, just a bad person.

This is complicated by the fact that I absolutely have ADHD and complex trauma from severe emotional abuse during childhood. My former therapist thought I might have some borderline tendencies. I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt a year and a half ago after I couldn't deal with the shameful thoughts about being fired from another job due to risky and inattentive behavior. I believed I deserved to be punished. 

I don't get angry, but I do get irritable with my husband. I'm very agreeable towards everyone. I managed to graduate from college at 26 years old - during that time I was working full-time, going to school full-time, and at one point I wanted to take on *another* job and work over 70 hours/week with school full-time. I am now in graduate school and scared of screwing it up, even though my professors say my ideas and understanding are very advanced.

As of recently I¡¯ve been off of Abilify now for a month and a half, still on lithium, but been doing really bad have had too much anxiety to leave the house/drive anywhere I also don¡¯t have a job  which doesn¡¯t help and been really depressed and don¡¯t feel like theres a point in living... don¡¯t know what to do..I dont know if it¡¯s the lithium causing all this or just depression followed by my manic episode. I also don¡¯t want to get on SSRIs because I¡¯ve heard it those just numb your emotions even more, but have heard of ECT and have been thinking of talking to my doctor to do that. It sucks being bi polar just want to be happy again/normal."
bipolar,KevinsFolly,2020/1/23,"DAE deal with uncontrollable rage? I think I might be in a manic episode.  I've been really tense, obsessed with moving, having trouble focusing, and getting really, really angry.  When I have an anger outburst I just tear into people.  I am wondering if anyone else experiences this?  

I'm currently on Latuda, Gabapentin, and Buspar.  Seeing my Pdoc today and thinking about asking for something else that can control mania better."
bipolar,Smkabwlwme,2020/4/11,"What are some signs that you have had that helped you realize your depression was more than just depression and that you were bipolar? Hey all, new to this community and just trying to figure some things out for myself. I am really wondering what signs and symptoms you showed that made you realize that your depression was more than just depression and was bipolar disorder?

I am a 32yo male that has struggled with pretty severe depression over the last year stemming from an engagement that ended not by my choice. I dated the girl for 5 years and she had a child that I helped raise for those 5 years and between the loss of the relationship and not being able to see the kid anymore, it hit me really hard and has definitely changed me as a person. 

I show the obvious symptoms of depressive episodes like being sad, feelings of hopelessness, zero enjoyment from anything, extreme lack of motivation, fatigue, lack of concentration, etc.

What I am not sure about is do those symptoms go more into the bipolar side of things. Some examples of things that I have struggled with in the past that make me worry I could possibly be bipolar:

1. After depressive episodes I can get really focused on something that I think will make me get out of my ""funk"" and make me start to feel better. Usually these center around my career pathway and what I want to do with my life. When I was younger, I jumped around majors just about every year because I could never focus on one until I finally dropped out of college. I've worked in the restaurant industry for awhile but never felt like it was where I belonged. I just did it because I could make good money without a degree. I went back to college in my mid 20s, got an associates, and then never used it. I most recently have gotten interested in going back to school again for something completely different but I'm not sure if I am doing that and just working myself up for it because I have been laid off from my job due to COVID-19 and just want something to focus on. Basically, I'm 32 and still not sure what I want to do with my life because I can't fully commit to anything. 
2. I rarely finish things that are not work related. I have hobbies that I have done in the past and still do sometimes like reading, video games, and wood working. I will start a book and get into it and then halfway through just stop reading it and never finish it. Same with video games. Same with woodworking projects. Do half, decide all of a sudden I'm not interested anymore, never finish. And this is with A LOT of things. Including school in the past (see #1).
3. I'll have extreme flashes of anger sometimes over small, trivial things. Like a shaking rage where if someone saw me in public acting like that they would probably be scared of me.
4. I feel that I have an increased sex drive and am going down holes that I have never gone down before. I am single and have been for awhile and haven't gotten laid in forever and just feel like some days I can't get enough. (I have not randomly had sex with anyone, just more porn than normal.) I may have chalked this up to just being single and depressed before but over the last couple months I have gotten more and more into things that I just don't feel like are me. A few years ago I would have never questioned my sexuality but now I definitely do. I wonder if I am bisexual now or if my mind is just looking for something out of the ordinary because what worked before, hasn't worked recently. 
5. Last November when this really hit me hard, I quit my job. Just didn't go and called them and told them I was done. I have never done this in my life and if there is one thing I have always been able to take pride in in myself, it was that no matter what restaurant I worked in, I was always considered one of the best employees and would NEVER not show up for a shift and would definitely not just quit out of the blue like that. I then went unemployed for 3 months while I saw a therapist and tried to figure out what was wrong with me. I blew through about $30,000 in savings starting a little before I quit the job up until the end of January. Some was from just everyday expenses, rent, whatever. But a decent portion was just buying things I wanted.
6. I've had a few episodes of extreme crying. One in particular stands out. One night I was just kind of closing my eyes and my mind started running. I felt like I had this out of body experience where I sensed that I was in my old home, in my old room, I was watching TV in bed with my ex and her son was running around being goofy in the living room. It felt like I was there. Extremely vivid. I could feel everything. The color of the room, the decorations, the noises. I opened my eyes, came to, and lost it. The heartache I felt was so intense and I cried harder than I ever have before.

I feel that there are other instances to that may correlate but I don't want to write a book. I know that I have not suffered from full blown mania but possibly hypomania with swings from feeling happy and like things are going to turn around for me one day to all the way down in the hole the next day. I have become more and more worried that I am going to start making decisions that would become a huge hindrance on my life and feel like the only reason I haven't over about the past month is because of COVID-19 not allowing me to quit my job (ya know, cause layoff) or make other extremely negative life choices that I would quickly regret and put me further in a hole.

I know I need to talk to my therapist about this (I have been seeing a counselor and not a psychiatrist) but was just wanting some thoughts from people who actually live with the disorder. Am I just worried and extremely depressed and COVID-19 is just making things harder right now or could this go further than just depression? (Obvious answer is yes, it could. So, please don't just say talk to your counselor/psychiatrist.) Any advice or thoughts or things that you have found helpful would be greatly appreciated."
bipolar,dshiznit92,2020/2/20,"Getting off Seroquel? So I¡¯ve been on Seroquel for just about a year now, and honestly I hate it. I sleep so deeply and so late every day. Im talking deep to the point of hearing big banging noises in the middle of the night and not being able to get out of bed deep. And I used to wake up so easily but now I will sleep for eight or nine hours at night, wake up at about 9, and go back to sleep until almost 11. I¡¯ve never been like this is my entire life and it¡¯s taking a toll on me.

It has also started making me feel like I cannot process my emotions properly, I feel kind of hollow. I can¡¯t convey when I feel really happy or frustrated or mad or irritated, I feel like a caged animal. Now several years ago I was put on Lexapro because they thought I just had regular depression, which just made me feel like nothing but in a more positive way (later discovered that when combined with adderall and undiagnosed bipolar it basically sent me into an unstoppable manic episode lol). I don¡¯t like the way either of these medications worked with me, and I just want to know what you all have done if you¡¯ve gone through similar situations.

I¡¯m trying really hard not to just say fuck it and go off of them completely, I know that¡¯s really unhealthy way to be and I don¡¯t want to do that to my fianc¨¦, but I hate feeling like this almost as much as I felt when I was unmedicated.

bipolar,_poho,2020/3/27,"Nervous about new medication I had to stop taking lithium very quickly because my levels went toxic super fast and I developed hypothyroidism. Prior to the blood test that picked it up, I was okay with taking lithium, it had some annoying quirks, but it helped. Coming off it was tough and very stressful, and I am not in a great headspace. 

I've been prescribed lamotrigine. I've had the pills sitting in their box for a week, and I just can't bring myself to take them. My lithium experience has made me really nervous about how quickly things can go south, even with a drug I thought I knew relatively well. Lamotrigine is a total unknown and I'm really anxious about it. I know I need to take it because I'm undermedicated and not doing well, but I've got such a mental block.

bipolar,bubtigharv,2020/2/8,"Psychiatrists/doctors I am so emotionally, mentally and physically drained to the point that I just want to give up. I¡¯ve had different kinds of mental illnesses for 9 years now and was diagnosed with bipolar 2 about 2 years ago. I¡¯ve been questioning this diagnosis recently. But since my mental illnesses have started I have not been able to find a good psychiatrist that actually cares and helps. A lot always remind me about time and are just plain rude and mean some I controlled what medications I should try or go up doses on since I¡¯ve done so much research at this point and they just agree with me and prescribe me any medications others threaten to take my anxiety medication which I have been able to taper off of on my own but when I¡¯m going through medication and dose changes I take more since my anxiety gets so bad. Some don¡¯t even listen to you completely and just care about time and rush through and don¡¯t even give you details about the new medication they prescribe. I¡¯ve even went to a psychiatrist that had me do so many ketamine treatments that never worked and cost me $40,000! I feel like majority of them don¡¯t care and are in it for the money. Also I started having really bad panic attacks and anxiety at the age of 18 up to 3 times a day even ending up in the hospital multiple times thinking I was dying. I didn¡¯t know what anxiety was or panic attacks so I didn¡¯t know what was happening and none of the hospitals told me what was going on. I went to one of my friends doctors one day that¡¯s not even a psychiatrist and didn¡¯t even know her for my friends appointment.

I¡¯ve stopped drinking for a few weeks now (was not a massive issue before I stopped anyway) and haven¡¯t smoked weed in months now. I¡¯ve been trying to take care of myself.

I'm just curious as to your lives before diagnosis and what pushed you to get diagnosed. Was it an easy diagnosis according to your psychiatrist? What was the process like? How have you been since your diagnosis? Was it hard to adjust?

I've always been scared of being diagnosed as bipolar because I grew up in a household that didn't believe in mental health. I'm just now exploring the state of my mental health and I feel like I'm in a constant state of wondering due to me being in college. I haven't gotten diagnosed, and I REFUSE to self diagnose. However, as I finally go on my journey to exploring my mental health and traumas, I want to learn to not be scared and to inform myself. My immediate family has a lot of undiagnosed mental issues due to our collective trauma (poverty, abuse, depression, struggles, overall fear), so I guess I'm also scared of not being able to lead a normal life. Learning your stories and pasts is something that's really valuable, so please share only as much as you're comfortable with. Thank you."
bipolar,Proto101889,2020/4/4,"Mixing Adderall with Mood Stabilizer? Similar situation? 
Long description is long...

So I have been taking Adderall XR at about 25 mg a day for almost 4 years now. I started having symptoms of depression when I was 18, I'm 30 now. It took me until I was 26 to finally get help with symptoms that seemed very much on par with either  ADD or bi polar depression. Symptoms like, being very motivated and on top of everything going on in life for a period of time before falling into these depressive slumps that would last from a few days to sometimes months. 
This was very difficult while trying to get an Electrical Engineering Degree when I was in College. It would seem like the depression episodes would cause a massive lack of caring for my schoolwork or to even get to class even once during the week. One semester it actually caused me to fail a class entirely because I never went. 
I eventually changed to another school for a fresh perspective thinking it may have been the environment. This continued at the new school but because it was smaller, I was able to be more accountable.

The severity of these episodes were different as well. Some of these got to the point where I laid in bed and began to cry over nothing, I don't cry over things, that's not in my personality outside of this.  It was alarming. Only a couple times did I reach that point. The lack of motivation to get things done suddenly would cause a massive amount of anxiety that I think made things even worse. 

Im a single guy who loves to workout and build things in the garage. I'm super introverted and would rather woodwork in my garage all weekend than go out with friends at all. I am constantly ""squirrel braining"" new ideas and projects to work on. During what I think are more of the ""normal"" periods, my brain knows what it wants to do and I can do it with a little coffee in the system. During these low periods, it's like I can't get excited about anything I was ecstatic about only a week ago. It's like there is no light in me. 

Fast forward to my final year in College and I hit a point where I reached out for help to the VA and the diagnosis was that it was ADD. The lack of focus would cause anxiety to build up about not getting things done and it would make it worse seeming like depression. They put me on Adderall XR and to be honest it really helped. I still had normal highs and lows like anyone but the lows were more like having an off day and my normal days did not become manic or anything. 

Over the past year I have been hitting more of these low periods, that are not crippling but I have to really work to stay positive and enjoy things. I came across ""r/cyclothymia""  thread and have read a few people's descriptions of themselves and I feel like I do have some ADD but cyclothymia sounds like it nails it on the head. The starting of 8 projects and then not caring about any of them, only to have motivation all come back at some later time hopefully, perfect description of me.

I was hoping maybe someone went down this road similar to me with the Adderall before realizing it probably isn't solving the root of the problem. 


Did you continue on the Adderall in a smaller dose while taking a mood stabilizer?

I'm asking all of this now because the last two weeks I noticed a large depression moving in, almost like the fricken weather. I have been less than useless with things at work, luckily we have been slow and all of my tasks have been internal tools."

bipolar,tersephrase,2020/1/23,"Depressing Rant Because I Can't Sleep [Self-Harm] TL;DR: My new psychiatrist changed my meds then shit happened. And now I'm a miserable wreck.

I feel so empty inside right now, even in my high-functioning state. I want so badly to have a crying fit and pass out. I'm basically managing it through sheer will for months. 

It all began when my PDOC retired and her replacement took over Fall last year. My therapist and I had hoped the PDOC would change my ADHD drugs, and have me putted on anti-depressants to combat my seasonal depression. On my first visit she made me take a pregnancy test and a few tests before she would prescribe any of my meds. What's worst is she emailed the whole clinic, advising all the other PDOCs not to prescribe me any drugs until I completed them. The pregnancy test was negative but some results were not to her liking, so she wouldn't prescribe my ADHD drugs. The Ritalin withdrawal messed everything up from sleep, mood, stamina and how I processed information. So I never followed up with the PDOC because I fell in a deep depression where nothing really mattered. 

While still depress my health insurance changed because I made too much money at my new part time job which I needed because I'm in debt. Which meant spending a month without my anti-psychotics while paying out of pocket for therapy and additional drugs until the new insurance kicked in. Also, founded out how important my anti-psychotics were, when I debated with myself on what tools I should use to cut myself with.

And I am very ashamed for a string of bad decisions during this period that included: asking every patient in the waiting room at the PDOC's clinic, what was wrong with them, and then following up with a suggestion to consider sterilization. 

Life right now is just grey. I was passed over for a promotion at my other part-time job, and now I think they might let me go. In addition, I didn't go back to school as planned, so I don't know what happened to my scholarship. Trying to appear normal and okay is stressing me out...I'm sorry I sound like a jerk and self-entitled child. Thanks for reading my rant."
bipolar,breeerin,2020/3/4,"Family member recently started Seroquell and their reaction to it is concerning, can anyone tell me if they've experienced this? Hi, not sure if this is allowed. I'm not seeking medical advice or anything, I'm just really worried and this person isn't communicating with their doctor like they should. Just wondering if any of this is normal. 

A family member or mine was recently diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and has been on and off a few medications. Last week they stated seeing a doctor who has them on Depakote and Seroquell. They're fine during the day on the Depakote, but once they take the seroquel at night, things change drastically. They were told it would help them sleep, but it seems to have the opposite effect? They're restless and haven't had any meaningful sleep in 6 days. I've witnessed them falling asleep standing up, falling asleep in the bathroom, and this morning it got so bad they fell over and got (minorly) injured. So it does make them drowsy, but only in spurts. After they wake up from that, they're really restless. They told me they've only slept 1-2 hours in the last week. 

They don't seem to realize how bad it is. I've done some research and it seems like this isn't typical, but either way, I'm concerned or their safety.  They DID contact their doctor about it, and was told to take 200mg instead of 100mg, and that it would definitely make them sleep. This is what led to them getting hurt. 

Is their anything I can do? Talking to them doesn't work. Is it possible for me to contact their doctor, or is that a complete violation of privacy? I don't want information on them, I'm just worried for their safety at this point."
bipolar,somewheresomehow_,2020/4/8,"Has anyone succeeded in taking medication as-needed? I've continuously been informed that ""it doesn't work that way"" and that medicating daily is essential to prevent episodes. I'm prescribed geodon, an antipsychotic that treats acute mania - although I struggle mostly with depressive symptoms.

I'm wondering if anyone has successfully been able to treat themselves when they feel psychosis arising? The common concern is that because mania initially feels ""good"" it's difficult for the person to decide to supplement it. However my last two manic ""swings"" I recall feeling particularly concerned for myself and was trying to make sure I was sleeping by taking cold medicine (DONT TRY THIS IT MAKES IT WORSE), THC oil, and xanax.

This being said I'm inclined to feel that because I have had this instinct but just the wrong medication, I'd be able to prevent psychosis so long as I have Geodon on hand.

Background:

I've had four episodes. I'm 21 now. The first one was when I was a 16 and was drug induced. The second I was 19 and was also drug induced. The third I had just turned 21 and was induced by a lack of sleep/stress/alcohol every night (a friend was visiting from cali). The last was due to a breakup and sleep deprivation. I recall wanting to take medicine in all but the first."
bipolar,donsgurl,2020/1/9,"I'm... lost Tl;dr at the top for your convenience: I (37/F) have been on bipolar and ADD meds for a long time and just started seeing a new psychiatrist who is inclined to think I don't have BP but instead some other personality disorder and I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around it and its implications.

I have ADHD. (I was originally diagnosed with ADD, but that doesn't exist anymore, according to the ""bible"" psychiatrists use for diagnosis codes - the DSM-5.) Anyway, I've been treated for that for years. Anyone who knows me concurs wholeheartedly with this diagnosis. Lol. Any therapist or psychiatrist I've seen also agrees. 

Fast-forward from that original diagnosis to a session with a psychiatrist about 5 or 6 years ago who originally diagnosed me with bipolar II disorder. He based his diagnosis on my lengthy history of manic and depressive episodes, as well as ""reading me"" (as I think of therapy sessions - as if I'm being psychoanalyzed, which I guess is part of what they actually do.) Doc puts me on meds and explains it takes medication along with therapy in order to effectively manage bipolar disorder. Let me back up and clarify that my history of manic episodes have included life-altering consequences, from divorce to probation and being a convicted felon, all of which my heart believes is out-of-character for me. 

Not long after beginning treatment with this psychiatrist, he ""Dear John's"" me. Well, at least his office did. I was short about $7 for my copay for a visit and said I'd come by the next day to settle up. I genuinely forgot to come back and pay. I mean, it's $7. I could probably find that much in change just searching couch cushions, night stand, and coin tray in my car. I genuinely forgot about coming back by. I'm looking forward to my next appointment. I check the mail, and there is a letter from their office. It stated that I was being discharged from his care and he wishes me the best of luck and hopes I can find someone who can continue my care. After calling the office multiple times in tears over being ""broken up with"" by my doc, I finally found out that the reason I was discharged from his practice was because I didn't come by to pay the $7. ARE. YOU. KIDDING. ME. So, drop a bomb of a diagnosis on me, put me on serious meds that should not me quit cold-turkey, and then leave me to fend for myself with no explanation until I begged for the reason and find out it was such a trivial reason. 

I floundered around for a while and finally got to see another psychiatrist who barely did anything for me. It was at a lower-income facility. Sometimes people work there and give their all because they CHOOSE to help needier people, and others? Well, I got the other kind. I'm not sure of her reason for working there, but she wasn't very helpful or empathetic or whatever. So, I stopped going. My NP who is my primary ""doctor"" took over prescribing the meds the last psychiatrist had me on, so at least I was medicated, right? 

Well, one thing the first doc had right was that it takes more than just meds to manage this disorder (at least in my case.) After such bad luck with psychiatrists, it took a long time to work up the courage to start going back to therapy. I went back to the last clinic I was going to, but booked an appointment with a therapist and refused to see a psychiatrist. Well, my therapist is the bomb. Seriously. She's one of those who's heart is in the right place. The concern over my mental well-being just emanates from her. She's helped me work through so much. 

Here's the thing: One day, after having established a great rapport and relationship, she tells me she really wants me to see a psychiatrist there. I said that I refuse if it's going to be the last lady I was seeing. She told me that that lady doesn't even work there anymore and that there is a different doctor that she thinks could help me a lot. She said that she thinks I was misdiagnosed, and that she feels I either have Bipolar I disorder, or some other kind of disorder, but that our sessions have revealed to her that the original diagnosis just doesn't fit right. At this point, I trust her and agree to see the new doc.

I just had my first appointment with him on Monday. Bear in mind that he and I still have mountains of baggage to sort through before coming to a more definitive conclusion about what my correct diagnosis should be. What I'm having a hard time dealing with is the fact that he thinks I don't have BP at all. He said he can tell I have ADHD for sure, but that my history that resulted in the BP diagnosis may have been symptoms of a different personality disorder (which we haven't gotten to just which one yet.) But I've done these sh\*\*\*y things in the past - life-altering things, and when I was originally diagnosed with BP, I felt like I finally found out the REASON behind them. Not an EXCUSE, because I am a grown woman who knows right from wrong, but at least a REASON why I did things that I felt were out-of-character for me. But now I'm being told I probably don't have BP. I asked him through sobs, ""does this mean that I really am just a sh\*\*\*y person who does sh\*\*\*y things? That there is no reason but the fact that I'm inherently just a bad person?"" He said no, not necessarily, but that he understands that by taking away the BP diagnosis, I have to shoulder more of the personal responsibility for my actions of the past. 

I had come to think that these things weren't really completely my fault. It was just a chemical imbalance in my brain, and these things in my history happened prior to being diagnosed and treated, and now I'm much better and on meds and in therapy, so I'm doing ok, right? But now I'm questioning EVERYTHING. I feel like I have a good heart. But then what explains these gigantic ""mistakes"" I've made in my past? What kind of personality disorder do I have??? (This is a huge cliffhanger for me, since I really just want to know what's wrong with me so we can treat and ""fix"" it.) The new doc does think I have some sort of other personality disorder, but until we work to get to exactly which one, I'm lost. 

If you got this far in my ""novel"", kudos. I'm sorry for spewing so much out in one huge post. I just don't know how to cope, what to do, and what's going to come next for me. Thank you to those who stuck around to read my entire story. Even without comments or upvotes/downvotes, if you read this far, I would like to think it's because someone, even just one of you CARES. So thank you."
bipolar,purplekissez,2020/2/13,"Anyone else Bi-Polar but also a recovering drug addict? Recently been struggling with not only staying sober but learning to cope with life with Bi polar disorder. I¡¯m almost 2 months clean from almost a decade of on and off heroin/opioid abuse and about 3 years of on and off methamphetamine abuse. I started my prozac 20 mg back up again about a month ago. During this time things have slowly/slightly seemed to improve with my mood and life. My boyfriend and I moved into our own apartment. We also cut out toxic friends and have been focused on going to AA meetings, working at our jobs full time and just staying as busy and productive as we can. Of course even after these small improvements, I got it in my head that because there hasn¡¯t been more positive changes in my mood and then on top of that the loss of libido/sexual side effects I was experiencing again with this medication, that I¡¯d rather feel depressed and crazy as long as I can enjoy or want sex still. I¡¯ve been off the prozac for a week now and since i¡¯ve stopped taking my medication my sex drive has increased and almost seems to be back to normal. But yesterday i started having a depressive? episode. I highly considered walking out of this shit job I currently have without giving notice (I¡¯ve done this with many jobs in the past), Started entertaining the idea that since everyone just assumes i¡¯m going to be a shit person that I should just get high and do whatever the fuck I want bc I¡¯ll be judged anyway. I¡¯m just truly starting to feel miserable and hopeless again because I don¡¯t seem to ever feel content with my life or who I am as a person. Thankfully I didn¡¯t relapse or walk out of my job last night. I really need the money. But I still went home in an angry mood and unintentionally took it out on my boyfriend by just wanting to be left alone and not talk about anything. My depressive episodes seem to have a snowball effect too. All day today i¡¯ve just been radiating the same bad vibes/negative thoughts and energy about myself and life. Cried this morning because I hate my job and feel as if I have no purpose. I have a therapy appointment next Tuesday but I feel like no mediation is going to help me. I guess the only reason why I felt like sharing this is too see if anyone has any thoughts or advice. I¡¯m fairly new to dealing with my diagnosis in a healthy adult way. &amp; I honestly sometimes cant tell when i¡¯m having an episode, only reason i realized i was getting worse again is because my bf asked if i stopped taking my meds? ????"
bipolar,mothmanned,2020/2/26,"Bipolar and Sobriety: A gentle reminder I'm not going to brag about my own stability. Let's just say I'm successful.

Bigger than getting the right medical cocktail, bigger than going to the right therapist, and bigger than my other privileges in life, the largest beneficial thing I've done for myself is quitting drinking and using cocaine.

I went from weekly mood episodes and a steady hypomanic / manic energy to experiencing episodes about once a year - no coincidence, they happen when I slip up in my sobriety. 

If you're having trouble that you can't seem to escape no matter how hard you're working in other areas of your life, please consider sobriety. Maybe it's the missing piece of your recovery.

Are you an addict? Reach out to sober groups. AA, NA, Refuge Recovery, SMART Recovery, all available for free near you and online. Refuge Recovery in particular has been the best for me, as it closely mirrors my Buddhist faith.

If you're scared of going sober, than it is probably best that you do. And you'll reap the benefits.

Have questions about sobriety? Getting sober? Feel free to ask me anything."
bipolar,nocorianderplz,2020/3/7,"Seroquel &amp; Hunger Symptoms Hello! I was wondering if we could start a discussion on a topic I can¡¯t seem to be able to find any other information for regarding Seroquel and hunger. 

I have been taking Seroquel (Quetiapine) for Bipolar and Insomnia 25mg for 4 years now. A couple years ago I doubled dosage and went back to 25mg because it made me less groggy and my body eventually adjusted with no issues. Although ever since i get severely hungry within 30 minutes to an hour after taking. 

I take it at 10:20pm every night and am asleep usually before 11.30 or midnight, often the thing that can¡¯t let me sleep is the hunger if i don¡¯t satisfy it. And when i do satisfy the craving i will binge like crazy and pass out, literally pass out. The next morning i often forget binging and i have hangover-like symptoms that don¡¯t fade until late afternoon. I am trying to gather information on how to avoid the hunger as it¡¯s a symptom i don¡¯t have regularly, and if i do binge safer ways to do so without the hangover like symptoms the next day. I¡¯m an artist so the grogginess the next day can often debilitate my creativity, thus putting me in a emotional slump.

Any personal experiences with Seroquel and hunger would be appreciated!"
bipolar,stilltryingeveryday,2020/2/9,"How to get professional help when the first time was a disaster Last year I finally admitted I needed help. I saw my doctor, actually two doctors, and was referred to a psychologist. This was a HUGE step for me after suffering for years with suicidal thoughts. 
The entire experience with this specialist was a complete disaster. I developed severe anxiety when I started seeing her; I would make plans to end my life before and after seeing her, I started self harming, and my mood went from very bad to extremely worse. She was supposedly one of the best and I was ""lucky"" to get in with her. 
Months passed and I finally had enough. After too much time feeling like I couldn't speak and definitely not improving, I called the clinic and begged for a new doctor.
They insisted I had to see that doctor again so she could refer me to someone else. 
I never heard back. Instead, I was discharged from the clinic without being told. CAS called me. That doctor called child services to tell them I was not emotionally available for my children and was not getting help. CAS were the ones who told me I was discharged from the clinic.
This was in October and I still have not been told officially that I was discharged.
I explained to Children's Aid what was happening and basically there is a record that a doctor called about me but they didn't feel like a follow up or house visit was necessary.
Since then, I've been seeing my family doctor. He has a psychology degree and he's been trying but he admits he can't really help. Afterall, he is primarily a family physician.
The wait for a psychologist is almost a year but I keep declining the referral because I don't want to go through my first experience with a ""professional"" again. 
I have regular nightmares about the experience and I feel like going to that doctor was the biggest mistake of my life.
I feel stuck because I don't want to go through anything like that again but my family doctor, try as he might, isn't actually helping. 
I just don't know where to go from here. I have the logical thought of trying to find a psychologist that works with me but I just can't take the risk of getting another lousy one.
It's not that easy to just try to find a new psychologist because now I feel like there's too high a risk of something happening to my kids since there's already been a call to child services. My husband says the chances are low of that happening since my previous doctor obviously did it vindictively and that I should try to get the help I need but I'm too afraid to take that chance. 

(I've already made an official complaint regarding my treatment to the hospital and the board of doctors as the communication at this clinic was awful and I feel like the doctor can abuse her power since she can manipulate my words to suit her actions. Regardless of her professional opinion, I should have been told I was being discharged instead of telling Children's Aid I was refusing treatment. ) 

This post isn't about this doctor or whether or not she did something she should or shouldn't have. The point is I don't know where to go from here."

I noticed I was running low last Thursday and asked my pharmacy to fax a renewal request to my PDoc. Monday rolls around and the pharmacy says it was sent back to them saying they had the wrong number. I confirmed the number with the PDoc office and told them I am out of meds, so my pharmacy would be faxing over a renewal request. I called several times today, left messages at the PDoc¡¯s office asking them if they could renew the medication and letting them know I¡¯m having symptoms of withdrawal (shakes, nausea, lightheadedness). I got my pharmacy to fax another ¡°urgent¡± request for a refill, and still nothing. I¡¯m so frustrated and it feels like at this point my only option is to go to emergency where I¡¯ll be treated like garbage because they don¡¯t think it¡¯s their job to refill medications.

Sorry I¡¯m sure theirs already posts like this I just want to write it it out and here others experiences. The past year has been rough and been through the wringer. I¡¯ve denied I had issues for a long time, and it took me awhile until I came to terms with them. I grew up in the independent fundamental baptist church culture and mental illness/medicine is very taboo subject and stigmatised, much more so than it already is still.  Anyways I spent the past year going through shitty SSRIs and antidepressants my doctor put me on, Zoloft, lexapRo, Prozac, and Wellbutrin. I¡¯m not sure what triggered it, but those drugs severely brought out my hypomania. I do partially blame myself for not being as open as I shouod have , but I was scared for it to be true because my aunt was BP2 and commited suicide. August was the worst, I was the most reckless I¡¯ve ever been, I opened up every credit card possible and maxed them out, driving like a suicidal mad man , like 70 in a 25 or easily over 100 in a 45. It¡¯s a miracle I didn¡¯t hurt anyone or myself. I financed shit I can never pay Back and my casual drug became muddy riskier and even overdosed. At the end of August, I went through with my suicide attempt. I succeeded, I was dead, but a friend I called earlier called the copes 2 hours earlier and Turks out they pinged my phone and found me with less than 2 minutes to live. I used carbon monoxide from charcoal and placed it in my car in a remote location, and was knocked out within 5 minute woke up in the ambulance i couldn¡¯t believe it. Spent the next 10 days at the psych ward involuntarily, and it wasn¡¯t until the day I was discharged where t he doctor went over everything with me and started examining closer the timelines of events, I tried to hide a lot, and yet she still came up with a possibility of BP2 and wrote it out and wanted me to show it to my doctor. Well I had hid that shit, and continued Wellbutrin at this point since it wasnr an SSRI antidepressant. Still was very reckless, I dropped out of college 3 weeks in and pretended to go the entire semesters my parents don¡¯t even know. This week I just tapered off of it, and came clean to my doctor about what¡¯s going on minus my substance use. She determined what I feared all along, BP2 and also BPD. So now I start on Lamictal / Lamotrigine 25mg for 2 weeks, then 50mg for 2 weeks, and 100mg for 2 weeks and we¡¯ll raise it up after that as long as no rash and if it works.

In the 17 years since my diagnosis, I have had constant mild to moderate depression, with 3 episodes of disabling severe depression, 1 period of mania, and 1 period of hypomania. 

I have been through an uncountable number of medication changes. Last May I took FMLA from my job, moved out of my apartment and into my mother's house, and had 21 sessions of ECT over the course of the summer. The ECT didn't work, but I attempted to return to my job anyway. I quit after 2 months.

bipolar,starter_kit,2020/1/8,"Judging my own disability Over the course of the last year I have only once experienced any acute symptoms of mental illness.  Truth be told my life has been pretty excellent.  I don't say this to brag only to give hope to anyone who is struggling right now.   Through my dedication to treatment and a focused effort to remove  stresses from my life I've been relatively comfortable.  I've also been horribly fortunate and had some tremendous support available when I needed it most through no doing of my own.

With that said, I'm a bit of an anxious mess right now because I applied for SSDI last year and I've been hired for a job at the local Uni.  It's somewhat  related to my former career and it doesn't give me the impression that  the demands will be severe.  The problem is that it pays too much money.   In order for me to continue pursuing my disability claim I need to  earn less than $800/mo and even after negotiating a PAYCUT the job still  pays $900 which according to my lawyer disqualifies my application.

There's  a part of me that doesn't really care about the above details because  there's an ever bigger part of me that is now questioning how disabled I  really am.  I have good hygiene, I make it on time to appointments, I  track conversations, I have a healthy romantic relationship, I am sober,  I get regular sleep, I attend group support meetings, therapy  appointments and doctor visits.  I ALWAYS take my medication...  BUT I  wonder...  Are the scars on my wrists an indication that i am disabled?   Probably.  Is the fact that I constantly questions peoples motives and  remain suspicious of intentions despite being medicated any indicator  that I am disabled? Maybe.  Does the fact that I have proven to be a  danger to myself and others while untreated say anything about my  ability to work? I don't know.  How about those three hospitalizations?   Is that enough for me to to be convinced I am not fit to work?

It's a horrible internal struggle that I'm facing and I don't know how to see my way out of it. Any insight you might have would be great."
bipolar,Ohanasmom,2020/2/25,"First Stay as Inpatient I have newly discovered Reddit, but can't stop asking questions.  There is just so much life experience here!  

Here's mine:  I (45F) have severe Bi-Polar II disorder.  Went 26 years before diagnosis and medication.  Then a sever car wreck a week later (not my fault, almost killed me).  Many more years before medication again.  I grew up poor, had no insurance most of my life, worked steadily (mostly 2 jobs) while going to college, then grad school, and helping my family 3 hours away.  Then finally, graduated, work in the professional field (ironically helping those on disability go back to work), and then meds again.  

My husband is AWESOME.  Wouldn't be alive without him.  We have been married 8 years and he has dealt with ups/downs/medication changes/life.  We have been looking for a good combination of meds for over 8 months now.  Maybe closer to 16, but I can't bear to analyze.  It has been horrible.  Add to that the fact that we are in an isolated area in a state that is 49th in the country for health care.  Additionally, I had another medical crisis that involved hormones, which just made everything exponentially worse.  

We are at the end of the line, people.  I finally agreed with husband and the family who really cares and have decided to go inpatient to get this straightened out.  It will take time because of the situation and our location, but I have insurance (yea!).  I have the luxury of choosing a facility (as long as it's in my state and covered by my insurance), but all I know is what I have seen/heard from clients.  And that is limited, since once they reach this point, they are not usually working so close with me.

I thought to look for facilities with low bed counts, a good variety of staff, medical staff as well (since they are still adjusting hormones), serve a variety of disorders (in case there is one/some that have not been identified), and have an individualized program.  

Honestly, my biggest fear is that my attitude right now is, ""I've worked and gone to school, maintained myself, my business, and been there for my entire family every time they needed it (7 brother &amp; sisters, y'all).  I'm not about to have someone tell me that the only way to maintain in life is the lights on at 7am, off at 9pm and we have you journal in between.  Yes, I have crashed, many times.  I don't need hit over the head with a bat that my sleep schedule is my problem for 45 years and I need doped up until I can no longer function (been there).

What are your experiences and advice?"
bipolar,kyeur,2020/2/5,"Kind of Confused I am 19 year old male and have really witnessed my mental state deteriorate over the past couple years.

I guess it started around when I was 16 when I started feeling immense sadness, didn't want to wake up from bed, lost all interests and had no passion. But I also had these somewhat short crazy episodes where I would feel extreme happiness, like completely elated, a point where it could turn into rage at any second. I'd shift from being completely dead to being more than the life of the party in a minute. I thought wow this is how people always feel so I should aim for this always but I always found myself in the depressive state, hoping for something to elevate me. Overall it was all manageable where my parents didn't really notice too much and my school and extra curricular were good. 

In more recent times, I'm mostly very sad all day, I want to talk to people but want to be left alone, I want to party all night but really just stay in. Honestly I feel like my brain is at war with itself. I hit extreme happiness sometimes but i can't control when it hits and how extreme it is. I can't focus in class and have no motivation to so naturally my academics have suffered really badly, social life is basically non existent and don't really a see a solid future for myself right now. 

I also have some kind of I guess OCD tendencies where I keep track of the most nonsense things and stupid rituals that I HAVE to follow or my day wouldn't go right (balance my fidgeting and facial movements, do certain things with certain hands, etc.) . I only find solace when I can get myself to sleep or I'm completely distracted (maybe when I work out or watch something engaging). But by the time I go to bed I find myself closing my eyes thinking 'god please let me rest' cuz I'm just so exhausted from my brain's hyperactivity. 

After reading some of the posts, I observe that most of the experiences I read are very extreme compared to what I experience, like the 'manics' I have are not that crazy I still have somewhat control of myself. 

I'm not sure what is wrong with me and i don't want to self-diagnose and throw the word 'bipolar' around because it wouldn't be appropriate, but to anyone reading who's been diagnosed or can relate to anything I've written above, what can you advise?"
bipolar,kingbroot,2020/4/17,"really intense mood swings I (17m) have had symptoms of bipolar 2 since age 13 and was diagnosed at age 15-16. I¡¯ve been on lithium for a couple years now and my stability is way better with than without it. Usually the bad emotion I experience in mood swings is being really depressed but sometimes, especially more recently it¡¯s switched to really intense anger. These periods of anger don¡¯t last that long (maybe a couple hours max) but they¡¯re so intense and damaging to my best friend (17f) and my life that i consider them much worse than the depression. I have a complicated history with her (we dated for 10 months prior to very close friendship), so naturally there are topics that will cause us to argue. I don¡¯t have a problem with that as a concept, but I do have a problem that sometimes this ¡®triggers¡¯ me to get into this very angry mindset where it doesn¡¯t feel like it¡¯s myself anymore. It¡¯s like my actions are on some kind of autopilot and even if I try to fight it, irrational thoughts will always prevail and have the final say. I know I hurt her feelings when I¡¯m like this and I want to take responsibility for my actions and prevent that from ever happening again but it¡¯s so hard when I don¡¯t feel like I¡¯m in control during these times. My mind moves so fast and I¡¯ll believe anything that fuels my anger it seems. I try to tell myself what¡¯s true (for example I¡¯ll genuinely believe that she doesn¡¯t put effort into our friendship even though I¡¯m trying to tell myself that¡¯s not true and there are many real examples of how she does logically). Sometimes when I¡¯m making a point in an argument, I¡¯ll say ¡®am I wrong about that?¡¯ not to sound condescending but because I genuinely don¡¯t know if anything I said is real in those moments. Im seeing a new therapist again (which has never helped me before tbh) but I really don¡¯t know how much that will help.

I¡¯m posting this because I want to know from other people who may have similar mood swings to this: how do you get yourself to take control when it seems impossible? How do you properly apologize to someone for being an irrational prick meaningfully if you don¡¯t know how you can prevent it from happening again? 

I¡¯m really scared that I¡¯ll lose my best friend someday because of this. She¡¯s patient with me and there are so many good and healthy aspects to our relationship itself, but this brings out the worst of it. I know my behaviour is very toxic and I want it to stop, but I don¡¯t know how to control myself when it doesn¡¯t feel like I¡¯m the one in control."

bipolar,Imnotwhoiam669,2020/4/6,"Anyone I can talk to about my symptoms? I'm diagnosed bipolar but I don't think it fits Sorry in advance, I'm kind of jumping all over the place. Really feel agitated right now.


I'm basically a big ball of confused. I was diagnosed BP II when I was in high school, but I don't think its entirely accurate. I've always struggled with mood regulation, since early childhood. I've struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts on and off for the vast majority of my life. Self harm too.


But I don't think I experience any mania. The only manic symptom I relate to is periods of  extreme irritability, but that could be depression too. My depression usually displays with anger.


I feel I go through some sort of cycles from relative ""normalcy"" and periods where I'm on edge, irritable, self destructive, suicidal. But I would rarely say I ever feel totally stable. I relate strongly to a lot of symptoms of Borderline personality disorder, and have been pretty comfortable with self identifying with that, except for the brief periods of ""normalcy"" I go through, where things feel ok and my world isn't constantly ending.


My mood seems capable of swinging as quickly as going from pissed to calm in a few minutes, or taking as long as a few weeks to get out of depression. 


I don't feel I fit cleanly into any diagnosis, and I have no idea how to get a correct one. I took a test with a professional and it said Bipolar 2, but it also said I was a social recluse with a drug problem who is incapable of holding down a job, which is absolutely inaccurate as I'm a very social person with friends and family and I've been consistently working since I was teenager, and I definitely don't have any drug problems. So I'm certainly taking those results with a grain of salt.


I'm just really lost and want a label I can identify with. Anybody well educated in mental health and bipolar, who can chat with me and maybe offer some insight? I'm not looking for a diagnosis, just some material to go to my doctors with."

My boyfriend has bipolar disorder. He seems to be in a depressed phase more than manic but can change multiple times in a couple of weeks. He has tried to kill himself a couple of times this year and I am trying to do my best to support him, but I would love to know what you all would suggest to help him and cheer him up when he gets in a depressed cycle. Often times, his racing thoughts put him in a depressed mood or something annoys him and he remains depressed for the rest of the day. He also struggles with low self-value and has told me that he often feels that life has no value. I want to help him see his own self-worth, but it is hard for me to know how to do that without understanding where his mind is.

I would love to hear your suggestions on how I can best support him and get him to a better space. Thank you all in advance."
bipolar,ApprehensiveBaker6,2020/2/16,"Just a messy rant of my last few months Rant/I just need to express to people who understand.

FYI i tried to reorganize the message but im struggling to focus dont think ive eaten enough and i just wrote along with my thoughts so its a bit chaotic

After a rough couple of months of extreme highs and weekly med changes i finally reached a point where i have returned to work. Prior to this i started rapidly cycle to extremes and was seeing a doctor on a weekly basis as i live rurally  we only have the psychiatrist visit once a month and the adult one who i had just begun seeing was reposted else where, and the new replacement skipped  his first day due to it being too hot, i finally saw him but  i only was able to express very basic information something about him made me dig my feet in and not want to share i tried a second appoitment but same thing happened along with him expressing his doubts as to whether i did have bipolar which hurt as since a had been diagnosed a medicated i had a large period of several months for the first time 7+ years where i didnt feel chained to the ground tho signs of mania which i had previously thought were how i should feel. since thne i am now trying to find a psychiatrist in the city while im doing that i was referred to the mental helath nurse who recomended i use an app to log my daily moods, its helped it shows that my highs and lows last longer than i think they do which helps in appointments. though i still have weeks where i feel flat and weighed down im at least not suicidal though my highs fluctuate from mild reckless driving and hypersexuality im mainly able to keep them under control though they do reach the point where i should definitely not drive as im a severe danger to others and myself resort to sexting and spend mininum of 3 hours though often more and all im left feeling with is disgust self hatred and a vow ill never do it again. despite the relative stability of moods im still experiencing visual hallucinations which only ever occur with my mood changing to either extreme. i usually have some indicators of my mood signifcitally changing of sounds especially people talking turning into a painfull buzz which reverberates in my head, or just being told i sound like im on a high accelerated speech, chatty, fidgety these are often pointed out by others from there i take 25mg immediate release  qutiapeine which will stabalise me for a few hours.

I made a lot of bad choices that were completely out of character for me during those two months and now that I¡¯m seeing a psychiatrist and taking meds I¡¯m trying to pick up the pieces. I hurt my husband, our children, and my family. I know this will be a life-long journey and that this is just the beginning but I would like to hear how everyone has dealt with their diagnosis (advice, personal experience with bipolar, reaction to different meds, etc). For reference I take 10mg of Lexapro and 300mg of Trileptal daily. My psychiatrist thinks this is good place to start since I seem to exhibit more depressive episodes than mania. The first time I saw him I was in a deep depression, no motivation to live whatsoever. I¡¯ve been on my medications going on 6 weeks now and I feel better than I have in a long time, things aren¡¯t perfect but definitely better than where I was. The only side effects I¡¯ve had where nausea, headaches, and some acne but things seem to be evening out besides the skin problems. I¡¯ll probably have to see a dermatologist soon.

I'll start to pick up, get to feeling stable again, and then around two weeks later I get hammered back down. 

This is the longest I've stayed medicated, and the longest I've gone without at least a short hypo episode. I feel like my episodes are shorter, but also much more depressive than I'm used to. This has been a terrible year for most people, and the quarantine isn't helping, I get that. So how can you tell what's caused by life and what's caused by the bipolar disorder?

I've been seeing a therapist every other week and have met with them twice so far. I'm prescribed Risperdone and Fluoxetine together and I'm skeptical of their effectiveness treating my bipolar. Furthermore at the beginning of taking these medications I was very high spirits but now I'm feeling low and sleeping way more. I feel depressed and like I'm losing myself. I also take CBD which makes me less anxious but thats about it, it has helped with restoring some joy. I've informed my therapist that I've been self treating myself but they are against it.

bipolar,LoisLaneEl,2020/1/5,"Might be having an episode So for about a year now I¡¯ve been fighting off a depressive episode.

bipolar,vronhubbard,2020/4/13,"Had to hospitalize my boyfriend against his will yesterday This was the hardest thing I have ever done, and I don¡¯t know if I did the right thing. Apologies for the long post!

Background: boyfriend is diagnosed BP1 borderline schizophrenic, and this is the first episode he has had since we have been together. It¡¯s his fourth manic episode in 10 years, he was hospitalized the first two times but not the third time. He had been hypomanic for at least two weeks prior, but having never experienced this with him I didn¡¯t recognize the signs. 

So 2 weeks of hypomania followed by 5 1/2 weeks of full blown psychotic/manic episode. This episode was the first time he was ¡°aware¡± he was manic and having lucid moments. I was able to stay home with him due to COVID, and really thought we could manage it at home. Every time he would be lucid it would give me hope that he was improving, but no improvement would stick for more than a few hours. His doctor was very little help, and would say things like ¡°you can up his lithium if you want to¡±. The only new med he added was clonazepam for sleep, and he doubled his perphenazine and lithium. We would have to argue every night to get him to take the clonazepam, and it kept getting worse. The night before last he took out his pocket knife and flipped it open 6 inches from me and said ¡°do you have any idea how dangerous I could be¡±. I gave him some time to calm down then tried to give him the clonazepam and he was running away from me. I called 911 and the officers came out, they said they could commit him if I wanted. I told them no thinking that maybe the threat of hospitalization would be enough. He was on his best behavior the rest of the night and slept. When we woke up the next morning, he was fuming. Didn¡¯t want to take his morning meds (this had never happened) and I blocked the door to get him to take them. He pushed his chest up against mine and got right in my face and asked if I wanted to continue breathing. He eventually took the pills, but was outside screaming for hours after and I finally called again. The officers took him on an involuntary hold. 

He¡¯s been calling all day crying and wanting to come home, and he doesn¡¯t understand that I can¡¯t come visit because of COVID. 

I¡¯m hoping the second opinion from a different doctor and the lack of things to stimulate him will help. I never thought he would actually hurt me but I was so worried he wasn¡¯t going to be willing to take his meds because it kept getting harder and harder and taking more fighting to get them to take him. After 5 1/2 weeks he still thought he was god and fully delusional. I feel awful that I can¡¯t even visit and like it was selfish of me to do this to him. It feels hopeless."

anyway, i'm here to vent about my illness and hopefully gain some direction, support, and see if others can relate.

official diagnosis is bipolar I rapid cycling (with psychotic features). luckily, my delusions come on only as a consequence of abusing stimulants or psychedelics while manic OR quitting weed cold turkey after longterm use. one is more severe and the other mild, respectively.

this is the way my cycle has gone for the last 3 years now:
weed &gt; hypomania &gt; more weed or other drugs + st*rving to somehow gain control over myself/situation &gt; mania &gt; depression &gt; mixed episode &gt; baseline. over and over like a goddamn merry-go-round.

but i'm here to vent. the rapid cycling sucks either way, and i was bipolar long before the drug use, and during my periods of sobriety. so what the fuck?

bipolar,MundaneAlternative,2020/2/13,"How I live with someone who is bipolar. As of today I've been with the person who is bipolar for l over 2 years. In the last two years my partner has been hospitalized once for a month.
He has experienced hypomania and full blown mania (last one was the main reason for his family to make the decision to forcebly hospitalize him and have court ordered force treatment). He either has long depressive episodes or short but really bad manic episodes. For a little periods he actually is stable. But those stable periods usually doesn't last very long. 

What I have noticed, is that person who is bipolar is much more sensitive and susceptible to extreme things. ( For example this year the global virus threat sent my partner to manic episode.) I know that I can't stop him reading things online and what he reads, all I can do is be there for him and help him if needed. 

But how to I live with the person every day and how do I know when he's depressed or when he has full blown mainia or hypomania? Well, it comes with experience, you start to notice small things that the person normally doesn't do. As for example: he doesn't eat much or sleep. Mostly sleeps 2 to 3 hours per night. Has a lot of energy and wants to have everything done immediately. That means he has either hypomanic episode or manic episode. 
But it can be different from person to person.

We do have most needed medications at home and when needed he does take them. It's better than being hospitalized. When he was in the hospital, he did receive electric shock treatment which he didn't like and to be honest, it was pretty horrible to look as bystander. He didn't remember who he was or where he was.

So to all who have a family member or a friend who has bipolar, the best advice I can give is to stay as calm as possible and try to notice simple changes in their behavior and speak patterns. What they say or what they suddenly think that is important to them. Don't try to reason with them but try to guide them softy in the direction where they are at one point when they want to take the medication themselves. It can take as long as needed. But if you can't get them to take necessary medications.. Please call the ambulance or take them yourself to the hospital."

The one thing that is affecting me the most is when I¡¯m meant to be in an environment that is relaxing but people in my ¡®safe¡¯ zone are arguing, I get real bad anxiety and anxiety attacks too and this leads me to a real manic phase, it makes me have a million thoughts racing through my head, it makes me want to get up and move around really fast and start cleaning up and just doing things that are totally random like a totally different burst of energy... I¡¯ve even randomly downloaded something to learn computer programming on. I was wondering if anyone else experiences this? I only feel like this way when my body goes into the fight or flight mode. For the most part my mood is really low, like low to the point of not being able to get out of bed. During my manic phase where I feel like doing things, I often break down because I can¡¯t even fathom what is happening to my body and brain and I don¡¯t like not feeling neutral because when I feel high I also feel low too. I¡¯ve had about 4 of these phases in the past 3/4 months as I¡¯m going through a stressful time and it doesn¡¯t help when I can hear arguing or anything that triggers my phase. 

I was wondering if anyone with bpd can give me any insight on this? ie personal experience on the situation, things I can do to cope or whatever. Any help would be really truly appreciated as im kind of having that phase tonight and i know I¡¯m not going to be able to sleep which I hate! I just need something to calm me down but I know I¡¯m going to go through this for about a week now I¡¯ve been triggered. I can¡¯t cope anymore it¡¯s so stressful to feel this way"

But I¡¯ve always been paranoid of being fat, and these days I am on a fine line between normal and overweight. Granted, I know I am a tall female, but the numbers have been increasing slowly as the years progress.

bipolar,octupi,2020/2/27,"Advice on returning to work and mania tl;dr: worried about triggering a manic episode need advice

Just to preface: I have a diagnosis of Bipolar I with psychotic features and a history of long periods of mania. 

I guess I¡¯m looking for advice. I¡¯ve been on disability since 2016 and after a lot of different rehabilitation strategies (inpatient, outpatient day program, stable medication routine, and other numerous therapeutic practices) I feel prepared to return to work. 

Unfortunately the job I got is a 8pm-3am shift. My case worker is rightfully concerned about this disruption in my sleep schedule (I usually wake up at 6am) combined with other stressors in my life (I¡¯m getting married in June, moving on Saturday, going back to school in September, going back to work etc). 

I don¡¯t feel like mania is onset, I¡¯m not feeling any euphoria or delusions of grandeur I generally associate with my shifts. No psychotic symptoms I think. I have a lot of coping strategies and a great support network. On the other hand, I know my thought patterns are getting a bit more erratic, I¡¯m highly irritable, and I¡¯m engaging in a lot of potential triggers. 

I¡¯ve had some traumatic manic episodes in the past so I know it¡¯s also possible I¡¯m being overly diligent and maybe a bit paranoid about the possibility. I guess I was wondering what you all thought and whether it¡¯s worth the risk? I could really use the money and I feel like I¡¯m wasting away without purpose. 

My options are to continue with this job until I find something better or hold out and not work until something better comes up. I¡¯m limited by the long gap in my resume so I¡¯m also scared nothing better will turn up for a long while. 

Sorry this post is so long and thanks for taking the time to read it."

bipolar,themightyloner,2020/2/24,"New to the subreddit and new to bipolar disorder I found this subreddit and I've been reading through some of the posts. I look forward to reading through more; it's nice to find other people going through some of the same things.

I've been diagnosed with Bipolar II since late July of last year, though I think I first started exhibiting the signs 10 years ago after a series of traumatic events took place in my life... but at the time, it was diagnosed as depression and anxiety. I self-harmed as well but I have been clean for six years now.

Anyway so I'm 22 and I am trying to build myself back up from Ground Zero because I am not functioning at all. I have been hospitalized twice in the last six months (the last time being Jan) and I may have to go back AGAIN because this medication they put me on in the hospital (Abilify) has made my life a complete hell in the weeks that I've been out and I don't have a psychiatrist to go to. There is a major shortage of mental health providers where I live, to the point where I need to go to a hospital to get an assessment done just to possibly have any hope of switching my dose or taking me off the medicine completely. I really don't want to be admitted again because last time (in a different facility) wasn't much help at all and the chaos does a number on my anxiety.

Aside from that, I have been really depressed because I am unemployed and I have had an insanely hard time finding a job. I did a lot of ""job hopping"" around over the years; I have probably had over 20+ jobs since I first started working at age 15, the longest one being just over a year. I went to college and got a technical diploma but the whole 'need exp to get a job, need job to get exp' rabbit hole has me trapped and I can't find work in my field. So that is definitely a huge stressor.

My family, for the most part, doesn't care. The small amount of irl friends I had left after they found out about my dx. I have a few online friends but I am slowly discovering how toxic they are; they constantly make me feel bad about myself and tell me I'm constantly playing the victim whenever I mention feeling depressed... even though they have mental problems too. It's confusing. Has anyone had exp with something like this before? It makes me feel really bad about myself.

I'm just really sad, lonely and struggling with my disorder. I hope someone here can relate to me. Maybe we can talk.

Thanks for listening. ?"
bipolar,_Thrive_Alive_,2020/2/21,"I know this isn¡¯t really a place for relationship advice, but since it has to do with my being bipolar I figured I¡¯d ask here. At what point should you tell your partner that you are bipolar? I have been in a relationship with my partner for sometime...and everything has been going very well comparatively speaking. Probably because they are so sweet and understanding about things...

We¡¯ve had a few chats about mental health struggles prompted by the fact that I do have some fairly extensive old scarring...and also just the typical deep talks people have about life and self development.  

I¡¯ve been more open and honest about my life with this person then I ever have in any other relationship...Our bond is something that I¡¯ve legitimately never experienced before, it transcends all the weird stuff that comes with being bipolar. I love them no matter what state of mind I¡¯m in. 

That said I haven¡¯t come right out and told them straight up that I¡¯m bipolar...

I met them at the start of one of my so called ¡°happy manic¡± phases, where I have shit loads of energy but for some reason my irritability and rage isn¡¯t also super active, so basically I was like the best version of myself.

Since then I¡¯ve been kind of all over the map emotionally but I¡¯ve never let my partner see the seriously bad(can¡¯t get out of bed,shower,or eat) side of myself. 

I don¡¯t want to keep things from them, but I also don¡¯t want to drop a bomb on what they probably see as a fairly comfortable relationship. I know they would support me and wouldn¡¯t decide to leave me if I fessed up, but I just don¡¯t want to burden them. 

My question is do I have to tell them? And if I should then when is the right time? What phase were you in when you told your partner? And what advice could you give me to make breaking the news easier?"
bipolar,laundryisdrying,2020/4/20,"Energy lulls and rushes within same hypomania Hi all, 

So usually in hypo/mania I experience an ever increasing level of feeling sped up, racing and fast thoughts/movements/plans/etc. Currently I've been wading in and out of stability to hypo for a few months now (diagnosed as hypomanic in February by a psych) where I'll spend a week or two of hypo build up and then I do things to sedate, relax, come back down to normal. Since lockdown the past 3 weeks I've been leaning more towards a mild hypo on most days but experiencing weird things in terms of energy/motivation. I'll have some nights where I only sleep 2-4 hours and am not too tired in the evening but I also have days where I am sleeping fine and even feel tired but I feel stoned like my usual hypo way of where I feel like the only drunk person at a party trying to fake being sober. Like now I can sit with my eyes shut in calm but be in complete bliss in my mind as if I have taken MDMA or am stoned. I am motivated and have started new activities but will also happily sit giggling and smiling to myself for hours which is not typical for my previous hypo/mania as I usually want to get up and do things. Long post sorry just trying to understand if this even is hypomania then as I'm not running around like a duracell bunny but the bliss/motivation/disinhibition is all there but I am also cool, calm and collected! Has anyone experienced this before or am I just in a really good mood and should stop thinking anything of it?

bipolar,Mellamellamella,2020/4/3,"I'm so sick of this - kind of negative I'm sick of having good days and making plans and waking up depressed, barely able to move, and so irritable I get angry when anyone talks to me or looks at me or touches me. I'm sick of lashing out at people.

I'm sick of going back to normal and feeling ashamed for acting normally and feeling good after being so terrible. I feel awful for being so nice and fun after being the opposite, like I don't deserve it.

I'm sick of feeling my brain declining, forgetting the words for everyday things like floor, table, car, plant, and feeling dumb for stumbling over what I'm saying. I'm sick of forgetting what I was talking about in the middle of speaking and just standing there trying to figure it out and asking people what I was saying because it feels like there is nothing in my head.

I used to be intelligent, I used to be able to have good conversations, I always won at Scrabble. I was known as the smart one in my family. I was able to give informed answers on various subjects, I used to read all the time. Now I can barely focus on anything, I can't read without forgetting what I read, I have to read the same line over and over. I can barely remember what I did the day before or even an hour earlier.

I'm sick of going to bed hoping I'll wake up happy, knowing that all the exercise and healthy eating won't make me better, because they certainly didn't prevent any of this.

I'm sick of feeling like I'm always crossing my fingers for good days, and knowing that when they do come there's nothing I can do to keep them from slipping away. All the good times, the nights I go to bed after a day full of laughter don't mean that I won't be suicidal the next day.

I'm sick of feeling like I'm waiting for my husband to leave me, like he'd be better off if he did. He left me in February and we got back together, but now I just feel like we're postponing the inevitable. Marriages involving a bipolar person have a 90% divorce rate apparently.

I'm sick of waiting for the delusions and hallucinations to get worse, and worrying that it'll turn out to be the onset of schizophrenia. I'm sick of feeling like there's more going on than I know. 

I'm sick of feeling like I stumbled into a life that a normal person should have. A good job, married to someone who is affectionate and kind. I only see other people when I'm feeling good, so in everyone's eyes I'm a healthy person, and I just feel like I'm declining every day.

I rapid cycle and I'm just so tired of not knowing who I'll be day-to-day. My sense of self is getting more and more unstable, and I feel less and less connected to reality. I don't feel real to myself, I look in the mirror and barely even recognize myself. It feels like I'm not even real and I hate when I do connect to reality because everything seems so confusing like I'm seeing everything for the first time. 

I used to be so much more than I am now, and I am just so disappointed in who I've turned out to be so far. I'm young, I'm only 24, but so much has already gone wrong, and I know there's more to come. Everytime I think I've got a handle on my issues new ones come up, or old ones come back. I wish I could give my life and the good things to someone who deserves it and can appreciate it and make sure the good things stay.

I'm not going to harm myself, I wouldn't want to go to the hospital and take up their time with everything going on. I just wanted to type this out, thank you if you read this far, sorry to be such a downer. Hope you are doing well."

My depressive episode lasted a lot longer this time and the change into summer did not help whatsoever.

My main concern is because I¡¯m starting to noticing some warning signs: 
-back pain (before and during each manic episode I suffer from severe back pain.. does anyone else??) 
-Trouble sleeping (insomnia)
-Change in appetite (over eating)

Or have you become abstinent through other means, what have you found that helped?

I'm 30, coming on 3 years clean. I also have Bipolar and ADHD. I have struggled with meetings since I began my journey, I have been through some real hard times, I get quite anxious in groups of people and my friends from the meetings believe that if I dont go to meetings I will end up using. 

My experiance with the fellowship is that if you dont fully conform to what is expected people start acting like you have the plague and stay away. I don't think it's all paranoia nor how I'm behaving as generally I feel relatively stable on the medication I am on. 

I decided that I am fed up of having to make excuses as to why I don't want to go. I have said to my friends that I appreciate their concern but the fellowship is not the path I want to follow at this time. We haven't spoken in a few days now.

bipolar,hypercubee,2020/1/17,"Anyone else feel identity confusion related to bipolar disorder? Ok so before I took Lamictal I had a sort of fractured identity. Let me make it clear that I¡¯m not saying I have dissociative identity disorder (DID). I¡¯ve been doing a lot of research on DID and there are just a few things I can relate to. 

When I was hypomanic it was almost like I was a different person that was unrelated to my standard self or depressed self. In my head I imagined I looked completely different (prettier, taller, different skin tone) and even gave a separate name to myself. 

Unlike with DID I didn¡¯t have any amnesia or disassociating. I don¡¯t hold any trauma besides the difficulties of being bipolar. 

There are other ¡°selves¡± I had at different times connected to my emotions.  Different names, ages, and genders. They looked different, dressed differently and acted differently. In my imagination I had them talk to each other. Sometimes comforting or arguing with. But it definitely felt closer to imagining than actually being another person?? I¡¯m having trouble describing this. Other people could only sometimes see a difference on the outside. 

Now that I¡¯m on Lamictal it feels like the different selves are one self. I guess it¡¯s because I don¡¯t need the coping mechanism. It¡¯s probably also because I¡¯m not swinging from hypomanic to depressed that I feel more like one person. Sometimes when I¡¯m very stressed I can feel myself going back.

So, I'm normally a fairly-high functioning bipolar person (or at least I thought I was) but I recently had a pretty severe, debilitating mixed psychotic episode which has lasted for awhile. 

Anyway, the plot thickens, I'm a college student! Bipolar and college don't mix very well obviously (haha), especially when you also have comorbidities such as OCD or anxiety. 

I've done extremely well in college but of course this episode had to occur right in the beginning of the spring semester so I got de-railed and am behind in a class.

I thankfully was able to get back on medication pretty quickly (was unmedicated, not too smart, I know) and am in the process of receiving treatment again but now I am faced with a predicament I've tried desperately to avoid. 

I'm private about my mental health and have never wanted to claim disability or accommodations for my illness. I don't want to be treated any differently or thought of any differently.

 Just lost another job thanks to a blossoming manic episode.  Would have been a severe episode but I locked it down with meds once I realized what was happening. Didn't realize fast enough I guess. Now I get to be worried about money on top of loneliness and self-loathing.

 Spent Thanksgiving through New Year's alone, including my birthday. One of the two friends I still have started seeing a new girl and has essentially disappeared out of my life. Other friend works weird and long hours, so I can go a month or two without being able to see them. I have reached out to all of my old friends and acquaintances without much luck.  I have one sibling worth a damn but they live very far away, and I have an elderly parent with their own severe mental health issues.  

 Aside from my pdoc, that is my support network.  It doesn't seem like enough, and I'm scared.  The vast majority of the time I don't feel secure, and I often don't feel safe.  Every gain I make in my mental health seems to fall apart before I can build on it.  I fight my way back out of the benzos and sedatives, just to relapse into crippling depression in a month or two. I fight to stay employed, simply so that I can watch myself lose more ground every year.  I hold no hope of things improving for me, and I'm not sure how long I can sustain the effort of living a life without hope for myself.

 I am not alone like some of us are, but I don't feel blessed either.  Every time I reach out and get weak or no responses, I pull a little further into myself.  This entire holiday season I have had an increasingly strong desire to just...let...go.  I'm not talking about ending things, but about just letting myself give up, stop caring, and drifting away into a meaningless life alone in my apartment with my cat until they come and evict me.  Asking new people to let me into their lives feels like I am being selfish. I have gotten to the point where I feel that I have nothing to offer anyone, that they cannot find somewhere else better and with less bullshit.  

 I'm tired of hearing about mindfulness and meditation. About attitude and aspirations. About finding the right mix of meds and therapists. You know what I want to hear? That pay in this country is no longer a sick joke relative to cost of living. That the healthcare system here would see me as more than a cost to minimized. That mental health is not a reason to be shunned and avoided by others. That I don't have to constantly put on a performance for others that says everything is OK!  That people want to actually help instead of silently but openly hoping I just go away and suffer somewhere else so that they didn't have to be uncomfortable.  That friendship where I live means more than exchanging memes over facebook.

I've been on Zyprexa for 4 days now, 2.5mg twice a day. yesterday I  started noticing random muscle twitching in my arms and legs. Nothing super noticeable or jerking movements, but wondering if this is a common thing?

Tardia Dyskinesia is reported to set in around a year in, not 4 days. So a little concerned.

bipolar,2020NM,2020/4/5,"Thinking about medication and pregnancy has robbed of sleep last night. Opinions? I might get pregnant in the next two years and I¡¯m the sort of person who like to have everything planned ahead. I think I¡¯d want to come off medication (Risperdal and Lamictal) before trying for a baby. But I¡¯m dreading what the experience will be like without medication. I have bipolar with psychotic symptoms (delusions, no hallucinations). I started medication 2.5 years ago and it stopped all delusions and I stopped being severely depressed/suicidal. So these 2 medications are literally lifesavers for me. 

However my main concern is having a healthy baby, physically and mentally. I¡¯m worried about any physical abnormality and any mental and developmental effects that might not show right away, but develop in late childhood or adolescences. I have a close-knit family and if I happen to develop any psychotic symptoms during pregnancy or after anything birth, or anything that will make taking care of the baby harder my mom and sisters will help me take care of it. My younger sister and older brother still live in my family home and we also have a housekeeper there (I¡¯m not from the US) so I can go and stay in my old room if anything bad happens and they will take care of me. This is the worst case scenario. 

I¡¯m trying to weigh the positive and negatives of coming off medication but I really can¡¯t risk causing any harm to the baby. I feel like it¡¯s not a risk I¡¯m willing to take. I saw posts about Lamictal being safe for pregnancy but I think it¡¯s too soon to tell if the baby would develop any mental problems when he¡¯s in adolescence or adulthood, Lamictal hasn¡¯t been there for that long and no studies have been done on this. I already risk passing on bipolar to the baby but I¡¯m worried the medication will cause it or other mental disorders or problems. 

Would me being in a depressed or suicidal state of mind affect the baby¡¯s development? Same for psychotic symptoms. Not in the sense that I wouldn¡¯t be able to care for them, but would that affect internal development? Cause I think I read that having severe stress while pregnant can cause abnormalities in the babies.

I know it¡¯s a completely personal choice but I want to learn as much as possible. I don¡¯t see my pdoc for 3 months and pregnancy won¡¯t be happening for another 2 years. But since I got anxious about this last night I wanted to vent and hear what you guys have to say. Please share as much as you can. Thank you."

""Perhaps people on the autism spectrum are more inclined to shun small talk and superficial banter and appreciate more close relationships than typically developing people. At least in the mating domain, there is [evidence](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2010.00041) that people with autistic-like traits tend to be less interested in short-term mating, and report a stronger commitment to long-term romantic relationships.

autism,Eric_Wulff,2020/2/3,"Gut microbiome composition and diversity are related to human personality traits See [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452231719300181) for the full paper.

And see below for an excerpt that may be especially interesting:

&gt;Since the gut microbiome has been implicated in social development and behaviour, recent research has investigated whether it may modulate behavioural symptoms of autism. Autism is not only characterized by impaired social behaviour but is frequently comorbid with gastrointestinal issues and immune dysfunction. Studies comparing autistic individuals with neurotypical controls often report significant differences in gut microbiome composition. Interestingly, a trial of faecal microbiota transplantation in children with autism found that it improved not only gastrointestinal symptoms but also social behaviour and communication, including two years after completion of the treatment. This suggests that the gut microbial community may play a part in the expression of autistic behavioural traits."

Why you ask, well what are superpowers? They are essentially handicaps... And what are mental disorders? They are also handicaps, and that superhero comics etc. arose during the first half of last century at about the same time as or a bit after modern psychology/psychiatry was getting started, is only further evidence of this likely intentional correlation that would have been designed for purposes of highly profitable media of all kinds as well as the contemporary pervasiveness and detrimental influence of the psychiatric profession, which would no doubt feed off of and bolster each other through this unforseen but fundamental link.

The superhero/mental handicap correlation is partiularly evident when you look at who is being cast as Bruce Wayne in the new Batman movie in development (hint: It ain't Jason David Frank), as if the throwback to the old 'nipplesuit' George Clooney films with the [metrosexual boofhead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Affleck) Batman from the last two movies wasn't bad enough."

Most noticeably, I start picking apart how I come across as not needing a bunch of support, how I was not diagnosed super young, and what was done in the process to diagnose me and who did it compared to other people. Furthermore, it just makes it hard to take myself or my complaints seriously.

My therapist has been trying get me to de-mask and have certain discussions with other people about my needs, especially my parents, who I still live with at the ripe old age of 22 after graduating from university.

autism,Commander_PonyShep,2020/3/1,"My inability to tell the differences between criticisms and personal attacks So as of right now, my stepfather is still sleeping, and I've been going up and down the stairs inadvertently making all sorts of noises that could wake him up.  And when my mother criticized me about it and told me to stay in my room at all times, my brain was literally tricking me into thinking that she was personally attacking me like some child abuser.

But at the same time, I am taking Fanapt, an anti-psychotic designed to keep myself calm and under control, even when dealing with my mother's criticisms.  Years ago, before taking Fanapt, I had bipolar disorder, and because of my years spent living with my mother, combined with my autism, I literally could not tell the differences between when she's criticizing me and helping me improve, and when she's abusing me.  All because her body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice indicated to me that she was about to personally attack me, whether physically, verbally, or psychologically, when she's just having a hard time trying to raise me and I'm making it difficult for her.

And as a result, I went on Facebook and ranted and raved about my mother being a child abuser, all because I couldn't empathize with my mother and remained self-centered due to my autism.  My older sister and stepfather told me to delete that post on Facebook, but I constantly told them no over and over again, and kept that post on Facebook at all times.  That is, up until my mother threatened to cancel my college career if I didn't delete it, which I did eventually.  My stepfather then dragged me to my psychiatrist, and he prescribed to me Fanapt, an anti-psychotic designed to keep my behavior under control.

Which all goes back to today.  I pissed off my mother with my noise-making because I am almost waking up my stepfather.  I want to treat it like it's a personal attack against me, again, because of her facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice.  But thanks to my Fanapt and other drugs I've been taking, I just moved on as if it never happened, and just did exactly as she told me, if only for my stepfather's sake.

autism,SeadawgCT,2020/2/29,"I've found that a recurring thing that may stem from my HFA is that I'm absolutely terrified of disappointing people It mostly stems from my parents. I was always terrified at the thought of making them angry to the point that I lied constantly about things I really didn't need to lie about. One time my dad told me to never accept rides home from school with someone else, but a friend had offered one to me so I ended up taking it, but I asked to stay at said friends house for a while because if I had gone straight home, I would've been home about half an hour earlier than if I had taken the bus or walked, and my dad would've put two and two together and I didn't want to face it. But because of this fear, I'm now terrified of going to job interviews, I'm terrified of going to any sort of social setting because I'm just scared that I'll be a disappointment to others, and I don't want to be that guy who's always living in a constant state of fear as to my inability to make people happy. Is there any way I can conquer this fear?"
autism,rpmanago,2020/1/8,"How do I (28F) help and support my younger brother (20M) who has ADHD, Autism and Intellectual Disability? My younger brother has recently been experiencing psychosis and paranoia (having hallucinations, thinking people are badmouthing him and are out to hurt him, thinking he is on the news and social media, lashing out and hurting others, cursing and screaming out of nowhere, etc.). We have consulted his doctor last Saturday, and she said that one of his meds (Concerta) might be causing his psychosis and that he was becoming treatment-resistant, so she has prescribed him new medications.

On top of this, we got the result of his psych test, and we found out that he has an IQ of 72, which means he may not be able to go to college due to his limited ability. He is currently in Grade 11 and delayed for a handful of years due to SPED school and therapy.

I am devastated by the recent events and feeling hopeless. My parents (49M and 48F) and youngest brother (13M) cannot fully grasp his conditions even after the doctor has explained the situation to them, and their patience, understandably, are wearing thin. I suffer from a mental disorder myself, so I understand him in one way or another.

If there is anyone here who is a parent or a sibling of someone who has similar conditions, how did you manage to help and support them? I love him dearly and would like to see him flourish and succeed in life."

I went on a date with another woman I met on an online dating app and thought things were going quite well with not too many awkward silences. I am nervous and haven't got much experience in the dating world, so I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be giving off a different vibe than just 'friendly'.

autism,Merrymir,2020/4/14,"Not asking for a diagnosis, but asking for advice I've been diagnosed with ADHD for about 5 years, though I was pretty certain I had it from a much younger age. Recently, when discussing some of the things I associate with my ADHD, someone suggested it sounded more like a sign of Autism - mainly, my tendency towards forming special interests, which I have been calling ""hyperfixations"" for years in relation to my ADHD-sourced hyperfocus. Since then, I've been wondering more and more if this might be true. I stim a lot, which I have always attributed my ADHD because it doesn't ""look like"" the other stimming I've seen from Autistic people. I have also always had a tendency to react to certain stimulus - mainly, loud noises and being touched without expecting to be - in a way that felt different than other people, and I always kind of thought of my reactions as PTSD-like symptoms even though I don't have PTSD. 

I also am extremely empathetic - I would even call it empathic - but simultaneously find it very hard to recognize when people are being mean or rude. I've noticed this mostly at work, because my co-workers will discuss politics and the actions/attitudes of certain people and I am always completely shocked; I just don't recognize it. I just have a hard time perceiving the behaviors of others in a malicious way, even when it seems clearly so to those around me. 

I guess what I'm looking for is any advice you can give me. I'm not sure if it even matters to have a diagnosis, but it's started feeling very important to me recently. From listening to a lot of Autistic people, I know there are very many ways to be Autistic that aren't necessarily reflected in the stupid ""am I Autistic"" quizzes I can find online. Are there resources where I can learn more about Autism from Autistic people? Do y'all know of any diagnostic resource that doesn't just work within the narrow framework of ""typical Autism"" (the Autism that you see in the media, which tends to be male-centered and cisheteronormative, which as a gay trans man I don't know if I can relate to)? 

TL;DR I'm sorry if this is against the rules because I know we're not supposed to ask for a diagnosis from you, but I'm not asking for that. I'm asking for your input on whether, at my level of ""functioning"", it is even needed to get a diagnosis, and if there are any resources made by and for Autistic people I can go to to learn more about it, understand how well my experience fits, and any other diagnostic resources that aren't for the ""typical Autism"" shown in most of the media."

autism,BwayPrincess,2020/1/3,"I¡¯m a burden to everyone I recently moved to New York City to go to the school of my dreams, and I was so excited because I got to move into my very first apartment and finally live my life as an independent woman, but I had to move in with two other classmates in order to figure out how to find my way around NYC safely. Honestly, I was not looking forward to having roommates because I knew there would be issues in regards to my autism, and sure enough, no matter how hard I tried to behave like a normal person, my roommates and I don¡¯t exactly have the best relationship because of my autism. So halfway through my first semester, I basically gave up on making any attempt to have a close relationship with my roommates because now that they know I have autism and have clearly made up their minds about me, I really don¡¯t see the point anymore.

I¡¯ve never been good at socializing with other people anyway, but now I choose not to because I know that the closer I get with someone, the more likely I will become a burden to them. I¡¯ve been avoiding making friends for about 5 years now because I¡¯m fully aware that not everyone understands autistic people. Not even my own mother understands me. There are many misconceptions about autism, and I feel like a lot of people tend to accept those misconceptions as truth rather than actually learn the real truth about autism. 

I have been in numerous relationships with family, friends, faculty, coworkers, and now my roommates where I have felt like I have been nothing but a complete burden to them. I want more than anything to live alone in my own studio or 1 bedroom apartment, but unfortunately I have to wait until my lease is up, which won¡¯t be until August, plus I am now completely worried about my future. I¡¯m afraid I won¡¯t be able to hold a job or have my dream career or even fall in love because of my autism. 

Pretending to be normal is not an easy task for me, and I wish I didn¡¯t have to feel like I should change who I am in order to please people. Ever since I moved, I have never felt more lonely and unloved than I do now. I¡¯m so sick of feeling like a social failure. I don¡¯t know what to do."
autism,Sinvanor,2020/3/28,"Do you think the ""empath"" experience might be someone who is on the spectrum? Also my experiences on it and autism so far as a recent diagnosed. Simply because I have e tendency to speak in a matter of fact way, as if everything I say is just reality, I will preface this by saying my formation of this thought pattern and idea on ""empath"" ability is based on my own experiences, anecdotal evidence and some research into autism itself.

So, I was reading about someone who was explaining that they were super emotional when others are in distress, IE crying with others cry, crying when animals cry and the more I thought about it, the more I think that this ""empath"" experience might actually be an autistic trait, specifically more for those who aren't bogged down by the confusion of social cues might be more reactionary immediately to distressing stimuli.  


In my experience, I'm on the spectrum high functioning. My particular traits are sensory overload, and over sensitive sight, hearing, sometimes smell and balance. I also have issues with certain textures and never realized that if I don't have music to drown out other stimuli I will panic if I'm alone or have a long trip.  
But I don't have much issue with social cues. I have mild issues with sarcasm depending on how it's delivered or if I know the person wouldn't believe x or y, but I read people fine for the most part. I feel most of my awkwardness in conversation is due to my social phobia rather than confusion about what someone is talking about or how to relate to the conversation. I do however infodump like crazy, even on a subject I've already talked at length about and my ADHD coupled with it means I have almost no filter, so while I made friends, I often was seen as a weird odd ball know-it-all.  I'm not ""classically"" autistic in a lot of ways and in others it fits me very well, which might in part be due to having ADHD on top of it.  
I am also  very empathetic, possibly too much so that the distress I feel in knowing others are unhappy, hurt or even in hypotheticals of those situations makes me anxious, sad and angry on their behalf, to the point that I'm not functioning well, which would be much better if I was so I can take care of them better and be there for them when they need a shoulder to cry or or just to talk it out. I also try to fix the problem because I can't stand being unable to have some kinda answer, even if it's not a perfect solution and am still learning that sometimes people just need to vent. 

So, when I was younger, I used to think the term ""empath"" fit me very well, was also pretty superstitious, religious and a bit occultist at the time (into horoscopes and really wanted magic to be real and often tried to think of ways that the magic could be scientifically possible). Being older now and more disillusioned with that way of thinking and far more into any possible science that explains it over the ""magic"" part of it all. I started to think that my ""empath""ness was probably my autism at work. In my experience, autistics have near zero problem with emotional empathy IE when they realize you are hurt or understand why something is hurting you, they show all normal signs of caring, if not get overzealous about the situation and overreact. What they can have issues with is cognitive empathy, the ability to formulate what is happening vs how the person may feel in a given situation, but not a direct connection to it, I would almost call this sympathy vs empathy, but I don't think using it that way is correct. 

  
The thing I've learned the most in recently finding out I had autism and getting a diagnosis is that I'm constantly trying to relate to the world around me and often bring things back around to my state and my experiences, a friend said it was how autistics tend to try to communicate that they understand, but sometimes it can come across as ego-centered, rather than trying to reach out and go ""I know how you feel""   
Most people can do this, but I've noted that autistic persons tend to feel another's pain, (when they are able to see it through the social cues of course) on a for lack of a better term, intimate level. In a way that almost feels overly heightened or unnatural vs seeing how their peers react to the same stimuli.  


Anyway, I think that the spectrum holds a lot of interesting things and I'm always looking for explanations that might fit otherwise unexplainable/supernatural experiences, ways of thinking or experiencing. 

Is there any other explanation do you think? I know there are quite a few very high functioning on spectrum people who don't fit classic autistic stigma or traits, but they fit a few select ones and thus are actually on spectrum. I feel like I fit into that category and 3 people I've recently met told me something similar as 2 just got diagnosed recently and one is currently in the middle of diagnosis."

autism,90hagr15,2020/2/14,"A question on nomenclature Hello!

I'm a student of psychology working on my master's thesis relating to autism/ASD/autistic traits, and have been wondering a bit about what nomenclature individuals prefer to use for themselves. In several studies I have seen mentions of self-advocates preferring the terms 'autism' over 'ASD', and during my education I have also been told that autistic people tend to prefer just that, 'autistic person' over something like 'person with autism' (which differs from many other things related to neurodevelopment, according to my professors). 

So basically I'm wondering, what words do you use and would prefer others to also use to describe yourself in relation to autism? Why? I've come to understand that (as with most things) autism is highly heterogeneous, so I come here to hear some individual-perspectives on this question, rather than brother group-level answers that can be found in articles/books/what have you."

To explain further John Elder Robison is a well known autistic person who underwent a course of treatment a number of years ago called [Transcranial magnetic stimulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation) and it had a huge effect on his autism and gave him for a time greater than normal levels of emotional empathy and continuing greater levels of empathy than before the treatment.

I am surprised that there is not more interest in the autism community about this.  It's like these experiences are ignored or treated as merely an odd anecdotal event.

autism,Leland144,2020/1/15,"My story in order to help with pacifiers techniques I was diagnosed with Autism when I was a Junior in high school, and my phycologist was impress that I created pacifier technics with every challenge. Furthermore, was surprised that I lasted that long as I was also diagnosed with ADHD, ADD, Dyslexia, Dysgraphia, anxiety disorder and depression which is typical with Autistic individuals to have these characteristics but not as severe or even more severe. As I viewed that god gave me a buy one get one free pass, but with the other disabilities which counter balance my above average intelligence. Henceforth,  takes away the ""get one free"" portion of that gift. Since childhood I studied body language by looking at the ""popular"" kid and I started mimicking. This helped me a lot throughout my life, and helped me in every social situation to look for the top individual in social situations and develop a correct format to act. My parents in addition unknowingly helped me by raising me in a ""formal"" format or acting in a southern high class fashion because of the order and rules when talking helped me set a consistency and a template because you don't have to read people in that atmosphere. For example; Holding the door, dressing nicely, how to treat women, how to respect older individuals and manners.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was in middle school my eye contact which was increasingly to be problem, so I practiced to control eye dilatation. When I talk to an individual I ""zoom out"" which makes the neuro-typical think I am making eye contact when I actually see just a blurry face in-front of me. I also recommend dressing more ""preppy"" which made me look more normal, and I found out in middle school that neuro-typicals make pure judgments on the way someone looks. I read a lot to gain information of emotions which an individual faces in situations, and psychological books in order to improve reading individuals. I created a set of principles which I hold to the highest regard as didn't understand social constructs. That helped me in the aspect of emotional situations, and a way of life as guidelines to act justly and to do good.  I pushed myself to be uncomfortable, to experience all range of emotions to feel and talk with people and to feel connected. I have multiple ways for me  personally deal with over- stimulus, and with brings me joy and individuals need to have safeguards in social situations.  Those are some of the pacifiers technics I use, but I use many different equations with different people I made which is too complicated to put on paper.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, I will tell you about how extraordinary Autistic people are, and my experience/words of hope of which someone I wish told me when I was depressed and was being made fun of/bullied for the most of my life.  When my high school found out that I was Autistic, they set up a parent meeting and requested that I am put into special classes. In addition, basically told my parents I probably won't be able to go to college or work normally. I started a lawn care company for my neighborhood when I was 13, started investing in the stock market at 14, started working at 15 to help support my family, help start a teaching volunteer group for underprivileged kids, freshman year in high school I started working as a statistical analyst for voting demographics in neighborhoods for politicians, did that another year while doing a college level law firm internship by cold calling law firms, was on 4 sports teams(not at one time). Now I am a sophomore at college, about to start a mentorship program for troubled kids, joined a top fraternity, got elected to Honnor court and in a senior level research team. I was called stupid all of my life because people didn't understand, and I used that as fuel and made me gain a passion for learning and always trying new experiences. My teachers didn't believed in me, and my parents don't believe in autism, so I had to help myself. Never give up hope. Keep fighting the uphill battle because you're stronger than most already. I hope I helped others in making there life a little better/easier.

I was at first inclined to consent to the evaluation, but then decided to waive the appointment, considering the Special Ed. Coordinator's opinion.

Yesterday our caseworker for state-funded services for Vocational Rehab called to let me know that she (the caseworker) needs a current evaluation before K qualifies for job search assistance. If I understand this correctly, there's no need for an official evaluation, a simple declaration of Autism, signed by a doctor will do. The only problem is that when K stopped taking medication for ADHD, she stopped seeing the ARNP for the Child Developmental Specialist who diagnosed K when she was 5 years old. She hasn't seen the Child Developmental Specialist in years, the ARNP more or less had taken on the role of K's ""Autism doctor"". 

I'm looking for advice and/or personal experience with this situation, feeling like I have dropped the ball, letting an important thing just skip right past my attention. K has a new PCP, she sees a therapist for severe Autism related anxiety and OCD, and she has several medical specialists for non-Autism related health concerns, but she does not have an official ""Autism doctor"". Should I try to get an evaluation through the school before the school year ends (May 15), or would it be better to see if the doctor who did her last evaluation can see her? 

Also, I'm asking to hear from parents of young Autistic adults about the process going from advocating for my minor child, as mom, to being my 18 year old child's guardian. Last year at age 17, K's PCP suddenly, without warning or notice, refused to allow me access to K's records. I called the clinic to ask for the results of K's lab tests and they said they couldn't share information with me because we didn't have the appropriate paperwork in her chart. The doctor's staff were (in my opinion) antagonistic and unwilling to explain to me why at age 16 I could no longer advocate for my daughter. It became such a battle to get correct info and direction from staff that I asked my PCP if he would see K, and he was happy to, and things are working out nicely.

K turns 18 on July 31st. She will be applying for SSI at that time, so a new evaluation will be asked for. 

Any advice or shared personal experiences are greatly appreciated."

I was wondering if anyone had any advice on not becoming overly excitable when talking about your special interest to a group of people, in a somewhat formal setting? I have become relatively active in a local political organisation, and I have been told that, although I have made good points and I have been very obviously passionate about them, sometimes the way that I am saying what I am saying becomes a tad too enthusiastic/aggressive. 

Usually, when talking about my special interests, I do not really moderate how I am speaking about them, but being in a group environment is new to me, and I worry that my over-enthusiasm will be interpreted negatively, as if I am being aggressive, and that it will put people off what it is that I am trying to convey. 

So, does anyone have any advice on not becoming overwhelmingly excitable when talking about something that you are very emotionally invested in?

Here's my problem: throughout my entire academic career I have always found a way to connect one of my special interests to the requested topic and produce something fairly good, but this strategy just didn't work out in this specific field of research. 
The deadline is in five days, and my poor time management skills, my extreme perfectionism when it comes to my writing and my inability to find a good research question was just overwhelming over the past week.
Today I was close to a mental breakdown because of it, so I finally gave in and wrote to my lecturer that I really tried my best, but I needed her approval for a new, pretty basic and boring research topic. 
Note that we had a lot of time to get this done and this was so last minute, any other lecturer would have just thrown me out of the seminar.
In the end of my mail I explained to her how I was mainly struggling with the assignment due to my ASD, I didn't do that because i want any kind of special treatment but because I trust her very much and I don't want her to think that I'm just lazy or I don't care about her seminar.
Prior to this, I had never told any kind of teacher about me being on the spectrum (I was diagnosed only about a year ago), which made me extremely anxious... but boy, did it pay off! 
She immediately responded in the middle of the night, she was super sweet and caring, offered to help me with my writer's block in her free time and pushed my deadline back another two weeks without me even asking for it!
I immediately started crying, which NEVER happens. Telling anybody outside of my closest friends about my ASD was a huge, horrifying step for me, and this small experience really gave me courage to open up about it and ask for help more often."

autism,ohwowie10,2020/3/7,"My older sister shows signs of being on the autism-spectrum, but I'm not sure? To preface this, I'm not saying that if your shy or quiet than you must be on the spectrum, but it's just that my older sister has characteristics that are usually associated with people on the autism-spectrum.  

I (F/18) have an older sister (F/26) she's very opposite of our whole family, and lot's of times I can't help but notice how different she is.  All of our family is loud, assertive, and overall very steadfast people (myself included)

My older sister though is the complete opposite.  She's very socially awkward and doesn't pick up on a lot of social cues, she doesn't make eye contact if getting into an argument but still gets aggressive in a soft-spoken way, and maybe the most notable thing was that she always rubbed at her legs and swayed really fast back and forth whenever she sat.  I always just associated this with maybe her not having very high-confidence and maybe some social-awkwardness, but tonight while I was on my computer I overhead her talking.

My older sister has always talked to herself,  and everybody in my family always found it a little concerning because she be mumbling to herself while speaking in a deeper voice, but than randomly start laughing before going back to mumbling.  

So, I heard her mumbling and got curious about what she might have been saying, so I sneak close to her and just hear here repeating the same phrase over and over again, ""I've had some pretty weird experiences in my life.."" 

I sat there for 2 whole minutes just listening to her saying this, before I returned to my computer and looked up key words of ""repeating sentences/words repeatedly"", and what it came up with was Echolalia.  I'm not very educated about the autism-spectrum, so please correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought maybe this could apply to her?

(TL;DR) My older sister repeats phrases over and over in a deep voice when no one is around,  she is very socially awkward and very opposite of our whole families personality, she's has exhibited characteristics that are usually associated with autism , so I've been wondering if she's on the spectrum."

autism,Bolticus13,2020/3/21,"2/3 of my workplace was just made redundant and I don't know how to cope. Long post. Hey Guys,

I am just posting this because I am currently going through a bit of a rough patch after two thirds (35 out of 50) of my workplace was just made redundant including the work mates which I would always confide in and would support me during time when I am overwhelmed and on the brink of a melt down and I don't know what to do.

For a bit of context, I am a 21 year old austistic male who lives in Australia who for the past 9 months has been pursuing work relating to my special interest (commercial aviation) as a customer service agent for a major international airline here in Australia (The way I got this job is a long story in itself and will be posted another day), now as you guys probably know more than anyone, a position as a customer service agent in the airline industry is not the ideal job for an autistic individual and because of that I have the habit of masking to the point where while I can function incredibly well at work (infact was promoted to be a business lounge supervisor due to my customer service skills after just 3 months of me working there) I have very little energy outside of work and while I am at work I am very much on the edge constantly as I no longer have energy to put towards dealing with sensory overload and sudden changes in routine. Due to this I have confided in a couple of work mates who know me well and know about my condition and go out of their way to make sure I am comfortable and assist me when they notice I am becoming overwhelmed as a way to function properly. 

This system has worked very well for the past 7 months. I have a code word I can tell my manager when I am becoming overwhelemd (in the lounge I am often alone so it is sometimes told over the phone) and when I say it they will send a staff member up to assist me or take over while I calm down, and when I am obviously on the brink of melt down they allow me and one of my work mates to go on an unofficial break to talk it out until I am good to start work again (honestly I cant fault my workplace they have been great in accommodating my needs). 

Anyway, as you should know we are currently in the middle of a pandemic with the caronavirus and one of the worst hit industry's is the aviation industry and as a result alot of airlines including mine has been required to make drastic cost reductions in order to stay afloat in a time where profits are few and far between. In my companies case this involved  laying off approximately 2 thirds of the workforce who are deemed non essential. Now as I said earlier when I am functioning I am very good at what I do, infact I have gotten more written compliments in regards to my service in my 9 months working there than anyone else has gotten combined , and as a result despite me being very new in the scheme of things. The company deemed me essential to keep at work (though be it with lessened hours) which I am happy about however all but one of my work mates who I confided in, in regards to my struggles were unfortunately laid off and the one who survived is being moved to another area which means I will rarely interact with them. 

With that in mind, ever since finding this out I have been terrified about going back to work. Without my workmates I  don't know how I will be able to function as they have always been there when I need it and especially now when alot of guests are agitated and on edge. I am scared that I will not function to an adequate standard and get fired and what not.

So while I can imagine this is a very unique situation for me to be in, do any of you guys have any advice. I need to work something out soon. Thanks."

I'm going to preface this by saying I am not a medical professional nor am I particularly well versed in this subject. For that, I apologize if I use wrong terms or come off as insensitive in any way. With that in mind, I was hoping this community might be able to assist...

I work for a small department in a large company in the energy industry. One of my coworkers, who is now my direct report, has been struggling a lot at work and is generally unhappy. After doing as much research as I can handle, I think it's very possible that he's on the spectrum (I hope that terminology is ok?) and am in need of advice. This colleague is incredibly smart - he's an engineer and incredibly analytical. However, he also seems to struggle working in a loud environment, is extremely process driven and has a very hard time adjusting to a fast paced, rapidly changing environment. Dealing with change is extremely difficult to this coworker, and to make matters work, many of my colleagues have written him off as being ""weird"" (struggles in social situations, often misses social cues to the point it can be a little odd in a professional environment etc.) He really struggles with collaboration and essentially cannot function in group environments and does much better on his own, when he can wear noise cancelling headphones. He really never makes small talks and seems to really dislike when social gatherings are organized, although he does occasionally come. When I've tried to ask him about his personal life, he seems to have a handful of specific hobbies, but to my knowledge no real friends and definitely no love interests. I believe he is around 40.

The reason that I'm asking this is because I want to figure out a way to try to provide a more enjoyable work environment, while also holding him accountable for doing the task at hand. Unfortunately, he has a lot on his plate, but so does everyone else (more-so, as we've taken steps to ease the load on him) and the nature of the job just requires him to get his portion done. I believe there are ways to help, but I'm not sure how much is inflexible.

So, I was hoping some of you may be able to impart some wisdom so that I might be able to help my colleague. He is absolutely miserable right now, and there has to be a way of making things a little better, even if no one else seems to really care and just is frustrated with him at this point.

autism,Timmeltor,2020/2/7,"My Autism Explained One commmon issue alot of autistic people face is the toll of executive function, the process of going from thought to action. We have a tendency to overthink things or atleast I do, I shouldn't presume to speak for everyone since our condition varies so drastically from person to person, but I feel this is a common problem.

   The way I experience it is that we need to contemplate things in order to understand what everyone else takes for granted, since most things don't come naturally to us. There is a disconnect we feel with the world around us especially concerning social interactions that we bridge with thoughts and questions, it is not that we are inquisitive just for the fun of it, but that we require it to exist and to relate to the world around us, it is inherently in our nature to see things through a lens of knowledge for else we are blind.

   Autism makes us question everything to such a degree that we inevitably question ourselves incessantly, the ""what if"" is so much more prounced to us than a neuroypical person and this in turn leads to alot of anxiety and in many cases depression, such was the case for me.

   This modus operandi of viewing the world extends to our emotions in a very powerful way, for atleast when it comes to my own process of experiencing things there is a very distinct disconnect between experience and emotion, a process of thinking what emotion I should feel in a given situation, It just doesn't come naturally. This has made me feel utterly inhuman and accelerated the disconnect I feel, my anxiety and depression. It has made me contemplate if I might even be a psychopath on a multitude of occasions. 

   For the longest time I have been paralyzed by this thought process, consistently getting stuck in mind loops, stopping me from experiencing life in any meaningful way, not even seeing my own hand in front of my face, or such an obvious thing as that the sky is blue. In the darkest moments of my life I even resigned myself to the fact that the only time I could feel happy about the things I wanted to do and accomplish, was in my mind, for if the ""what if"" crippled me so then I simply could never do them. Executive function was not only difficult but utterly debilitating, since I could not allow myself to feel anything before thinking over all the possibilites that entailed. However this has changed drastically.

   I had an experience beyond logic and reason so profound it made me question everything anew without any insecurities or bias, no bullshit, just me. It has taken me some time to come to terms with what I experienced and I am nowhere near done contemplating it, for it has made me see the world as if I'm alive for the first time, no lens, no filter. Instead of always thinking why I should feel something, I now do it after the fact, this fundemental change, this complete flip in cognitive behavior has changed everything. I now allow myself to give in to instinct and emotion and only afterwards do I think about it.

Even writing this it brings tears to my eyes since now I can finally allow myself to live instead of being a prisoner in my own mind.

   Im writing this for my own benefit but also for the benfit of anyone in my prior situation and since I now how we on the spectrum operate I feel that I must state some facts. This experience I'm talking about was induced through psychedelia, specifically psylocibin and what it has given me is beyond belief. I am not stating that it cured my autism, for I am autistic, it is part of me, I would not exist the way I am without it. It did however show me my condition in a way that was very basic but also clear and beautiful, it showed me an image like a painting I now carry with me, it described perfectly what autism means to me and it gave me such comfort and self reconciliation i can't even begin to explain it. But I will still try.

   Imagine a painting showing all the things you love and has meaning to you, music, games, art, all playing out in just the way you love them for, just the way you always react to them. Now imagine looking down to the corner of the same painting with an intent to see where it all comes from, where all of these beautiful things you love and appreciate originate from, and seeing nothing. All I saw there at the origin of it all was a black void, the perfect representation of nothingness. There it was, the root of it all, the meaning of my autism, or more like my experience living with it, that void is what I don't see, what I can't experience. But that doesn't take away anything, I still love and appreciate all of those other things just like any neurotypical person would, I just can't see ""that"".

   This is as I hope is evident a deeply personal experience, and this image I belive only has true meaning to me, but I felt I had to share it, because if it is to the benefit of anyone but myself then that would be amazing."

autism,Aran_Komatsuzaki,2020/2/24,"Foreign language acquisition for a person with high functioning autism I was diagnosed with HFA by multiple psychiatrists for showing very typical symptoms of HFA when I was a child. Being born in Japan, I came to the U.S. when I was sixteen, which was 8 years ago. Compared with other international students from Asia with the comparable number of years of experience in the U.S., I have reading and writing skills of English at similar level. However, my speaking and listening skills are noticeably worse, though I've constantly spoken English here and have never had any Japanese people around. 

Manifestation of my HFA has been getting progressively mild as I got older. Nowadays, it is pretty much impossible for anyone to notice that I have HFA or any sort of psychiatric problem. Only problems I have, which may be related to HFA, are the aforementioned problem with English and the loneliness I constantly feel. Since I do not have these problems in Japan, I'm pretty much a normal person there. No linguistic problem whatsoever.

That being said, I'd like to ask if anyone here with HFA or mild autism has been struggling with not being able to speak well in a foreign language despite substantial experiences."
autism,Sam1070,2020/1/11,"fired after disclosing my disclosing my autism disability hello, I am writing to you to ask the following questions.

1. I would like to know if there are any special rules or      laws in regards to being fired after disclosing my autism diagnosis/ disability      to my supervisor, ( disclosed it the previous day and then was fired when I      reported to work under a flimsy excuse that I was not the right      ""fit"" for the company even though there have been no problems previously.      The only thing that changed was I stupidly disclosed my disability when questioned      by my supervisor after direct sustained questioning for about 10 minutes on      how I was able to stay up for 84 Hours  to find this critical piece of software      and why I used my ability to hyper focus after being told multiple times      that it was extremely important to find this piece of software. I stupidly      thought using my ability to hyper focus to help the company find the      software after being told about it great importance to find the software      for free as the company did not want to pay for it unless absolutely necessary      would not compromise me and or cause me to get fired for disclosing my disability      and or questioned at length by my supervisor on how I was able to      accomplish this task and focus for such an extended amount of time. I was uncompensated      for my time for this and was told they don¡¯t pay overtime/ offer additional      pay  without being informed before      hand and getting clearance as they not obligated to under federal and or      state law per my supervisor for employees working outside of business hours      to find the software that I was told is of great importance to find .
2. About four weeks after being fired I met up with a old colleague      from the place that fired me and he disclosed to me that the reason why they      where given is that I answered the      phone even though I was never told not to, I was told I could use the      phone by my supervisor for project work which I was doing as I was not trying      to rack up my cell bill any more then I already did calling internationally      for there project they assigned me. (researching memory or finding an old      piece of software for example I was told to find a piece of software for a      Mitel phone system and due to my disability and my ability to hyper focus I      stayed up for 84 hours straight to find that software that they needed, I disclosed      that fact to my supervisor which made him question the reason why I did      that and that time I disclosed my disability to him and my ability to hyper      focus ( that what I call it anyway other people call it other things). I      was using the phone for that purpose to call a bunch of different vendors      and the morning that I answered the phone and was let go I was expecting a      call back from a vendor I reached out to to inform them that we no longer      needed help with finding the software as we decided to get rid of the      phone platform.
3. Did I compromise myself and or loose any chance on filling       an ethics complaint and or state or      federal civil rights case for being fired and not disclosing my disability      during the initial interviews, and seeking for an investigation to be      conducted against the company that fired me even though from my      understanding that I was not obligated to disclose my disability during my      interviews from my career counselor.
4. I was never informed of this rule that I was not      allowed to answer customers calls or use the phone what so ever by one of      the company¡¯s owners, Due to my disability I found it hard to interact      with outside the office during there weekly gatherings at a local restaurant.      The owners that told the the two employees I worked with that I was fired      never informed me of that rule nor did any of the other owners inform me      of that rule. I was told I could use the phone by my supervisor for project      related work which I was doing as I honestly thought it was the vendor I was      waiting for a call back from and not a customer as the shop was not opened      at the time when I answered it so I thought it was the vendor calling me      back.
5. I asked my supervisor plus all the owners if you have any      task you would like to do to please write up and send it to me either      through the chat app we used and or email and please do not tell me verbally      as verbally does not work for me and having it in a written form works      better for me. After the direct and sustained questioning by my supervisor      in regards to my ability to hyper focus and why I stayed up for 84 hours to      find that software that was so desperately needed and after I disclosed my      autism diagnosis to him he asked me if that was the reason why I needed everything      in a written form and I replied yes it was. (Did I screw up there and mess      up any case or investigation that might be launched in regard to the complaint      I will file)
6. Due to my disability during my the time I was working      for the company when I was invited to the weekly work gatherings if I was      attending I informed them that was not my thing and I don¡¯t like to do      that sort of thing, Because of that I was not buddy buddy with the owners      like my coworkers where in regards to the after work gatherings, They      where given the white glove treatment.
7. Under WA state or federal law are there any special      protections a person has for disclosing a disability such as autism when      asked by a supervisor why I stayed up for 84 hours straight.
8. What sort of attorney      should I seek out or look for as this is the first time I encountered this      sort of thing and  I am not sure on      the best course of action if it even worth investigating as it my word      against theirs and they have more money then I do since I live on disability      and ssi and don¡¯t make very much"

autism,AlternateForMemes,2020/3/15,"Thanks, y'all, for being you I should start by saying that I don't have autism, but despite this, I feel so at home with you guys. I have a lot in common with you, so much so that I've asked if I have autism myself lol. I've always felt that I was weird for being this way, especially since recently I've gotten a job working with severely autistic children, and seeing them do various passive behaviors, and learning from my co-workers that those things are not considered ""normal"" (like scripting, stimming, putting things in their mouth, special interests, etc). It's weird finding true joy in scripting along with the students in their movie scenes during break time, while my co-workers had never even heard of scripting before working with these kids, much less done it themselves.

Lately I've been trying to accept myself for who I am, and learn that not every aspect of me has to be ""useful."" This subreddit has been a great help to me, in part due to how much I can relate with some of you, and also due to how accepting and wholesome you all are. In this sub, you're unafraid to be you, as am I while I'm here. This has legitimately helped me in my real life, especially in my occupation. You've taught me that aversion to being touched is okay, being obsessed with something is fine, and that being socially awkward is, at times, a strength.

Thank you for being you, and showing me how to accept myself. ??"
autism,Kendorable,2020/1/19,"We need a better word than ""meltdown"" I really think we need to collectively adopt a better word than meltdown to describe the autistic meltdown. For one thing even though it's a common situation autistic meltdowns have not been medically designated a term. I think it's time for this to change. 

And while this is the case I think ""meltdown"" is a terrible word to describe the circumstance given that it is typically a synonym for tantrum and as we all know autistic meltdowns are not tantrums. 

One reason I feel so strongly about this is because I lost a friendship due to my own series of meltdowns following my father's death. When I describe what I was experiencing as a meltdown my friend was disgusted and ceased communication with me, not understanding that it was something out of my control and not giving me the chance to explain. He assumed it was a childish choice to display a rageful tantrum and did not want to associate further. 

Meltdown is a terrible choice of words. I personally have thought about potential terms to use such as ""sensory overload attack"" or ""overstimulation attack"" or ""processing attack"". I like attack, not unlike panic attack, because I think it gets the feeling across well enough that people who aren't familiar with autism at least understand that we are not making a choice to be  inconvenient and childish until we get what they think we want."

autism,birchmark,2020/4/12,"Australians who went through / are going through ABA themselves or have / have had children doing ABA therapy, was your experience positive, negative or mixed? Hi

I'm an Australian adult and I have ADHD but I have been told by my psychiatrist who treats my ADHD that I also probably have Autism (but he can't do the assessment).  I've hung around in these communities for a while and seen people talking about ABA, and I took the opinions with a grain of salt and did my own research, and developed my own opinion based on a mix of what I found and based on my own experience working with children, which included working in inclusive support roles in childcare and OSHC (before and after school care).  

&amp;#x200B;

I also noticed that ABA is one of the most recommended treatments here in Australia.  I've been assuming it is the same as other stuff I see about ABA (including documents and training stuff made for ABA itself) but I thought it may be a bit different to ABA in other countries, so I thought I'd ask if there are any Australians who have been through it / are going through it OR have children in it / had children in ABA therapy in some point, and whether your experience with it was positive, negative or mixed?"
autism,SupremoZanne,2020/2/18,"I hate it when people interrupt conversations! is it just an autism thing? or did people teach me the wrong things about conversation etiquette that resulted in me seeing it as a bad thing?

Unless it's just a one-on-one, I am not confident in conversations if I'm a third person involved at the table when two other people are continuously talking back and forth.  I feel like they don't sense a need for even timing for everybody involved.  It's like they don't represent the commas or periods in the sentence they have speech for.

The teacher at school programmed me to raise me hand to avoid verbal interruption, and ever since then, I started to seek out alternatives to avoid anything that constitutes ""interruption"" in conversations.

Any time there's a PERIOD in the sentences I finish, I usually pause my talking to see if others want to talk before I just go off continuing to talk, but sometimes somebody will start saying something a couple seconds after I initiate saying something.

I go off talking about TIMING and suggesting management of the SECONDS of timing of it.

Speech conversations are one thing I am not confident, or comfortable with."
autism,Oniknight,2020/3/7,"I was never diagnosed formally, but I am going to do right by my daughter I'm pretty sure my daughter suffers from ADHD and ASD to some extent.  She exhibits some signs of potentially having dyslexia issues for certain letters, and while she loves to read, she does not read at grade level.

When I think back to being a kid myself, I definitely had a lot of the symptoms of ADHD and ASD (hyperfocus, special interests, stimming, random vocalization, social cluelessness, rigid thinking, sensory processing issues etc), but my mom just responded to my ""quirkiness"" by shaming and physically harming me until I complied with ""proper"" behavior.  While it was effective, it made me very anxious and I often ended up being very quiet and obedient around her.  It left me with a lot of trauma and my relationship with hers is very minimal as an adult.

 I, however, do not want to harm my own children like this.  I do offer them different ways to deal with their needs (sensory, attention span, etc) but using tools and adaptions instead of demanding a specific set of ""normal"" behaviors. My kid still struggles, though.

Recently, our insurance has expanded and they  have an ASD/ADHD evaluation that is covered under our insurance.  I am very excited about this because before it was super expensive, and while my kids' school has set up a plan for her education, I want to make sure I am giving her every tool to succeed.

It's just a bit disappointing because while my insurance has plenty of resources for kids on the spectrum, their resources for adults are very limited or nonexistent unless you're  severely impacted by your ADHD/ASD.  I'm interested in watching the evaluation process and seeing how it helps her.  It's kind of interesting because she tends to gravitate to other kids on the spectrum in school, and I remember doing the same as a kid.  Maybe some of the therapies will also help me deal with some of the things I have trouble coping with!

It just seems really weird that there is hardly any support for adults with ASD."

I want to preface this by saying that my autism (asperger) deeply affects every part of my life, so I'm not saying this as someone who easily passes as neurotypical. But whenever I come across autistic communities online, it often feels like many of its members treat autism as an identity, often akin to LGBTQ+ communities. There's certainly a wealth of normal conversation as well, but the identity aspect of autism seems deeply ingrained in the communities and the dialogue within. 

This is not some plight aiming to change these communities - I'm sure you're all very well aware that the world doesn't work that way for any of us - but I was wondering if anyone else feels like an outsider within these outsider communities."

Unfortunately, most if not all people - even the couple on the spectrum I've met - seem to really enjoy talking, usually for long periods.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems to me I'm particularly odd in that my idea of fun while socializing involve simply doing things together in as much silence as possible, with the exception being games that require exchanging information, which I'm usually fine with.

I can hold short conversations well and learned people REALLY love talking about themselves, which is fine as I prefer listening than speaking but it does make me honestly wish I was deaf after the first 15 minutes.

Needless to say this is a pretty big issue for me and greatly worsened my already low capability of interacting with just about anyone. This one characteristic of mine mainly impacted my poor dating life, always resulting in either people being weirded out at me being quiet or them talking A LOT and me being the one to cut contact with them.

autism,L-F-,2020/1/3,"Looking for beta-readers for a comic script involving autistic character (Allistics, Autistics, anyone really. ) Hello everyone, some of you may have seen a few of my previous questions and the good news is that I'm finished with this draft at least, hopefully all the worse issues have been removed.  
Huge thanks to anyone who helped me out. Unfortunately the second autistic character probably won't appear yet, which is probably not all that bad considering I still need to do a lot more research, despite the wonderful answers I've gotten, to portray her faithfully.

Now, while I do have some Allistic people that have agreed to look it over, I've not yet found any Autistics that would review it which is something I'd like to rectify since, well, one of the main characters is autistic.  
The reason I'd like to hear from some more Allistics as well is that I'm probably autistic so there may be places where the Allistic characters seem a bit not-allistic and provide feedback on wheather or not the autistic character is relatable/understandable for you, as statistically speaking, most of my audience will be Allistic and if a few minor explanations or such would help avoid feeling alienated from one of the major characters I'd be happy to add them, as long as it's not a huge character change or focuses the story too much on autism rather than, well, the story.

&amp;#x200B;

Fair warning: It's probably not going to be very good prose-wise since Its mostly so I will have some idea what I'm doing once I start to draw.It'll also include gore, some swearing and ableism/racism.

The Genre is Fantasy, hard to narrow it down any more, it's going to be one in a series of several comics so there are some dangling plot threads. Most of the main characters are dragons and it's taking place in a coastal city in France (Most of the names are subject to change).

Here's a quick visual, the designs are still subject to change, though it'd probably not be anything huge:

[https://imgur.com/a/wnPLUYz](https://imgur.com/a/wnPLUYz)

The Protagonists are dragged into a series of murders due to a few coincidences, questionable choices and pure bad luck.  I've thought of more I could write, but most of it would be semi-spoilery so in the end I think it's best just to let it speak for itself, though I'd be happy to answer any and all questions you wish to ask.

I can PM you the script, I just don't feel comfortable posting it here directly.

I'm posting this here mostly because a lot of people I know think I'm crazy or I'm taking it a little too far.

We cannot be cured at least yet because we're still learning how it works, we don't have an exact cause, and there is just now complete acknowledgement that people like this exist despite the idea of it being around for over a century in our pop culture and thousands of years in our history. There are many properties that non-powered humans have and we can only be taught how to act as if we have them or to blend in a little bit better and not let our powers stop us from functioning in this Society, which since the beginning was established with a many stigmas that don't accommodate for us. Maybe it's not a disability or condition as people make it out to be, we are just misunderstood and we don't have the opportunities we need and we don't know the full extent of our abilities, they only come out when we cannot control our minds, or when the world is a danger to us and sometimes we only notice them when they are an inconvenience to us or other people"

autism,mossycoat,2020/1/16,"how to interact with people with power/authority? by ""people with power/authority"" i'm meaning anyone who has more social status, knowledge, and/or power than you do (a boss, professor, etc.) &amp; has some sort of direct influence over some part of your life (income, grades, etc.). i'll also note that i have a fairly extensive history of trauma, which includes interactions with ""grown ups"" as a child that were pretty damaging. so my difficulties navigating these interactions as an adult can, at a certain point, become complicated by that.

in my life, i've found that people in authority really like me because i take direction well, follow the rules, do a good job consistently, work very hard, show up on time, don't call off sick often, am fairly kind, etc. basically, i'm fearful &amp; obedient. however, i also notice things with the person in power/authority that are problematic (usually centering around them breaking ""the rules"") &amp;, when i notice incongruence between their words/actions, i ask questions--not big, angry ""WHY DID YOU DO THAT, YOU HYPOCRITE?"", but small, sweet &amp; confused ""how come you decided to do X? i think i remember you saying \[thing that contradicts X\] last week...?""

at a certain point (like, after several months &amp; when their ""breaking the rules"" begins to negatively impact me/my ability to function), though, i get impatient &amp; my questions get a little direct. at that point, the liking they have for me stops--&amp; it stops real quick.

in workplace settings, ""breaking the rules"" has been about my bosses not following the company policies/procedures in their interactions with me/other employees (which causes harm) but expecting us to follow those same policies/procedures... or selectively picking &amp; choosing policies/procedures if/when they fit the situation to punish someone--but \*not\* when they would hold the person with power/authority accountable for their own behaviors. in my profession, this ""breaking the rules"" has been about internship supervisors not behaving according to our code of ethics &amp; my professors failing to acknowledge that those other professionals are behaving badly when i seek input/guidance.

some people have referred to interacting with people with power/authority as ""playing the game,"" but i don't understand the game, the rules, or how to play it. occasionally there are phrases tossed in like ""professionalism,"" ""professional demeanor,"" and ""know your place,"" but what those seem to mean is not asking questions of people with more power/authority &amp; not organizing people with the same amount or lesser power than you to go talk with the people with more power/authority about the problems that are happening to try to seek some sort of resolution. it has been my perception that the latter behavior especially is very threatening to people with power/authority.

some folks have suggested to me that i just ""want to be right""--but that's not it at all. i feel right about very few things, *especially* when it comes to other people &amp; their behavior (humans do so many different things! for so many different reasons!)...which is why the rules are *so important* to me. it's about values, &amp; it's about saying what you mean &amp; meaning what you say, &amp; it's about (as they say) ""walking the walk"" while you ""talk the talk.""

how do you navigate this? to me it seems like there's many levels of dishonesty &amp; a lot of gaslighting involved. overall i dislike all of it very much, as it is something that consistently causes me a great deal of confusion &amp; emotional pain. if given the option, i would choose to avoid people with power/authority at all costs--but i'm not sure that that is an option for me at this point, so i'm wanting to understand it better to reframe the way i think about/approach it &amp; minimize burnout/the amount of energy i waste twisting my brain into knots trying to understand it."

I am trying to find noise canceling headphones and was wondering if anyone knew of some bluetooth headphones that could be used with phone calls that had active noise canceling, but where the active noise canceling could also be used if you weren't on a phone call or listening to media. I often wear over ear headphones that I find comfortable and if I want to listen to music, watch a video, or talk on the phone in a public place I put my earpods in underneath them. The problem is that I find that to be uncomfortable on my ears to have the cables pushed against them by the larger headphones and I can't wear them that way for very long. I have read 12 reviews and rankings of noise canceling headphones and watched three videos that said they would rank the top noise canceling headphones and discuss their features, but none of them said anything about whether the active noise canceling could be used while media was not being played and while not on a phone call.

autism,CrestfallenK,2020/3/11,"Advice for a Non-Autistic Person to Support Possibly Autistic Friend Without Enabling? Hi! I want to clarify before starting that I am not autistic and do not have experience with family members who have autism, so this is an area I lack knowledge in. I know a lot of articles use the term neurotypical, but I'm not sure of the ""qualifications"" for fitting either neurodivergent or neurotypical, since I have several mental illnesses impacting my functioning/social relationships/etc. but am not autistic? Please feel free to educate me on if this language is specific to autism. Please also correct me if anything I say is incorrect or insensitive. I'm trying to research, but it can be a lot to take in and remember. Additionally, a lot of resources I found were geared towards parents, which still have good advice but have some obvious differences between managing a parental relationship and a friendship. I want to educate myself and correct any mistakes I make in the learning process.   


To give a bit of context, I have a close long-distance/internet friend whom I will call Tim for privacy reasons. I've been friends with Tim for about nine years now; we met when we were 11 and are almost 20 now. Throughout the years we've fought and clashed a LOT due to misunderstandings (sometimes going several months without speaking), but we always make up, and we truly do care for each other deeply. Tim has always had some behaviors we didn't understand in our servers/groups, but we tried to be non-judging, but of course it didn't always work; sometimes we weren't as understanding as we should've been, sometimes there were just misunderstandings, etc. Well, coming back to the present, sometime fairly recently Tim's therapist he's gotten close to had asked if he had ever been screened for high-functioning autism. He said no, and she said that even though she wasn't an expert on the subject she noticed a lot of signs/symptoms that she said made her question it, and encouraged him to seek advice from a professional, which he now wants to do after lots of discussion with loved ones and research, but is struggling to have a screening covered with insurance. I'm in no way qualified to give an armchair diagnosis, but even though he's not officially diagnosed with autism at this current point I still think he seems to resonate a lot with certain aspects, so I hope it's still okay for me to ask here. I'm in no way trying to undermine anyone's struggles with autism since he isn't officially diagnosed, but desperate for help since we've been having tension and more frequent fights (started way before therapist's advice). Since we are long-distance I can't be there for the sensory and physical parts, but try to be a good friend in the social aspects.  


I try really hard to be comforting/supportive, but will be the first to admit I'm nowhere near perfect in this aspect. I have Borderline Personality Disorder, and although I'm going to DBT and taking medicine and actively trying to improve there are still a lot of moments  where I get upset easily if I feel ignored, invalidated, etc. or people aren't trying to understand me, even if it's not intentional. Tim also gets gets upset easily if people don't see things the way he does as well as other reasons. It can be a disaster having two people with such emotional sensitivity together, but I'm trying.  


The problem we struggle with the most by far is Tim's rigid way of thinking how things should be. Of course all people with autism have different personalities and it's possible this is moreso just his personality, but I've seen things talking about people with autism having rigid thinking and liking things a certain way (such as set daily schedules) and being very upset if those standards are changed or challenges so I'm not sure. I apologize if this is a wrong perspective I have. But once Tim gets an idea that's the way he thinks is right, he struggles to see other perspectives and asserts his way is the correct way. I try really hard to prevent fights by not challenging his ideas and assuring him ""Even if I do not personally agree or understand, your feelings are completely valid. We can agree to disagree."" or if its with someone else's perspective ""This is why they feel this way, but that doesn't make your feelings invalid or mean anyone in this situation is right or wrong."", but it doesn't work because he just gets angry with me or others for not sharing his views. We've tried to directly but politely tell him we don't appreciate him not letting us have our own views when he has his, but he either shuts down or lashes out at us for ""attacking him."" He also spams and rambles the group chats with things he's interested in and we try to show interest, but if the conversation starts to naturally flow to others interests he'll sometimes be like ""I didn't want to stop talking about that yet."" He just completely struggles with compromise, which he himself admits. A perfect example of this is when we were playing Stardew Valley as a small group last night. He mentioned he liked playing in the mines which we were cool with, but at one point another girl in her group (we'll call her Kate) went into the mines to grab an item, but he freaked out on her saying ""we agreed the mines were my thing and you're just going to disrespect me and take that from me? Ask permission first"" Kate was completely confused since we didn't realize he wanted to be the only person doing it and got upset, since it was her server and she didn't think it was fair she had to ask permission use a core aspect of the game when it hadn't even been explained why. But even though I try to accommodate to him I don't want to compromise our feelings either, since Kate was really hurt she'd gotten snapped at just for playing the game. I tried to comfort Tim without invalidating him, but also told him that if you play a game with a group of people you have to compromise and do what the group wants for everyone to have fun, and encouraged him to make a solo save where he can complete the mine by himself. He said, ""If I can't play the way I want to I'm not playing at all,"" and immediately left the game and went on ""Do-Not-Disturb"" mode on Discord. And I'm in no way blaming any of his rude behavior on the possibility he may struggle with autism, I know many autistic people are not rude, but I think we was a bit sheltered/spoiled anyways which just happens to make certain attributes stand out more.  I want to be a good friend and accommodate him because I am sympathetic that he views things differently sometimes, but I also want to respect my and my friends' feelings and not be expected to do all of the work. Any tips on how to be supportive without being enabling? Thank you so much and I truly do apologize if anything I said was ignorant."

autism,Apprehensive_Quality,2020/3/30,"Ways you break autism stereotypes? Autism is a spectrum disorder, and it has been since 2013. Everyone's experience is different, and many of us have exaggerated, polar opposite traits from one another despite receiving the same diagnosis. But autism stereotypes are still very, very prevalent. And while certain aspects of autism are very common among neurodivergents, this is by no means a universal truth. 

For example, autistic people are often thought of as being literal-minded. I¡¯ve never had an issue understanding sarcasm and other forms of figurative language. I also pay close attention to the body language / tone / expression / etc of whoever I¡¯m talking to; I adapted to do this ¡°manually¡± as opposed to intuitively like allistics, but the fact that I can do it at all flies in the face of most stereotypes. I¡¯m also hypersensitive to social awkwardness as opposed to oblivious. I can¡¯t stand awkward situations and sometimes I even see awkwardness where there isn¡¯t any. When an awkward scene shows up in a movie or show, I literally need to leave the room for the duration of the scene because I can¡¯t stand watching it. The same applies for witnessing awkward situations, or worse, being directly involved in one. Even when I¡¯m just a witness, I handle those situations terribly because I cannot help but overreact to the sheer discomfort.

autism,superfloree,2020/2/12,"Autistic Special Interests vs ADHD Hyperfixations This might be literally me being ADHD and hyperfocusing on something that really will not ever come up ever but basically there's a fake tv show my D&amp;D character in a campaign really likes and I've stated there is one character in there that is autistic-coded. It's just been left as just that for a while because this is literally a detail about a detail but my own characters involvement with the show has slowly started to become more prevalent and as such I'm worried about having to flesh out these sort of actual details and so I've been digging into misc stuff like this to make sure I don't misrepresent something. 

I'm not autistic myself but like literally half my friends are autistic and as I do have ADHD a lot of the outward traits present similarly even if they have different causes which I think had helped me understand a lot of the nuances and stuff, but one thing that's getting to me are how special interests are defined. I was originally under the impression that they're a lot more ""stable"" over time compared to ADHD hyperfixations that result purely from novelty and while that does generally seem to be the case I've read in places that some people cycle thru special interests after only a few days or weeks. While ADHD hyperfocus is usually defined to be a number of hours completely zoned into a narrow task I have also definitely had fixations that have lasted days to even a week or two because the novelty of the thing just lasted that long.

This basically leads me here, as I'm just wondering how a more ""short term"" special interest would differ from a more ""long term"" hyperfixation. What exactly drives something to become a special interest in general, and what causes you to lose interest in a special interest? If you lose interest in an old special interest, do you eventually return back to it at some point? Or is it more likely for you to just completely move on?

Though these days I'm thankfully no longer being bullied as much as I was, it still has left some ugly and lasting scars on me. My inability to fully trust others, hiding my stimming and other things that could point to me being autistic, assuming the worst in every person, being afraid to try out new things because of how often my mistakes were mocked by others and general tendency to get lost in my own head and shut myself off from the world. I lost faith in my own abilities when all I was being told was how much I fucked up everything, that I was ugly, weird, had no friends. Though I made it seem like it just bounced off of me harmlessly, in reality it stuck to me like glue. 

I learned to keep my pain from others, since getting a teacher or parent involved would only result in more bullying and pain. Through my upbeat and joking demeanor I concealed how I really felt. In actuality, I began to believe the many things being said to me, and stored my pain as much as I could, although I'd sometimes lose control at times, resulting in an aggressive outburst that only made people see me as a weirdo. When I finally moved schools because of my poor performance as a result of the bullying (I'd even ran out of the class on one occasion because I'd cracked under the emotional pressure and hid in one of the many bathrooms on one occasion), I learned to keep to myself and not draw too much attention, taking a step back and keeping my distance from others.

Nowadays I'm fine, on the outside. I managed to repair my friendship, opened up to people more at school and appear to be more social again, the pain and problems are still there, and I've never opened up about them except to my closets friends, who have routinely informed me that I should seek some form of therapy, or at least open up to someone who is able to help me treat these wounds. And they're right, I know it.

Unfortunately, I can't. I've tried countless times, so many times I've gone up and thought ""I'm going to do this today, I'm finally going to.""
But I've been too afraid. That I don't deserve help, that it's better that I continue to build up this pain and suffer alone. That they'll not take me seriously, and that they'll simply brush it off because I appear to be fine. The side of my brain that has been protecting me like this in years past is now working against me, and breaking free is the hardest challenge I've had to face yet."

autism,-_-__-___--_,2020/1/8,"Considering asking my psychiatrist to preform a case study on me. The case study would be based upon a different study preformed in 2011 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3040206/

To sum up the study linked. Autistic people (autistic men specifically) have a decreased expression of a gene called RORA. RORA is a gene that regulates metabolism, circadian rhythm, and most importantly, development.

The study also found that estradiol can increase the expression of RORA and androgens decrease its expression.

As an autistic male, I want to see if getting on a low dose of estrogen helps with symptoms. Specifically sleep issues and developmental issues.

I highly doubt that my psychiatrist will actually let me do this, but hey, it will be worth a try."
autism,vanjans,2020/1/20,"Resources for NTs with close autistic friends/partners Hi! I have a very close friend who's autistic. Most of the time our relationship is pretty good, I love their straightforwardness and we are able to resolve most misunderstandings , but sometimes it gets really complicated, my feelings get super hurt, I get upset, they're upset but not asking what's going on because they're avoiding conflict, I will not escalate fearing I'll upset them(or because I'm so hurt and have no patience or energy) and be passive aggressive and sad, and so on.

I've only recently started looking for resources, and all I come across is ""be friendly treat them like a human being"" 101 stuff basically. We're well past that stage, we've known each other for years and I'm more interested in more complex situations, how I should deal with my feelings and expectations in this context. Things like how to discern between situations where I'm right to be annoyed for doing all the emotional work, and where I'm just not being patient enough. What to do with feeling the need to mourn they'll never ask how I'm doing out of spontaneous interest. And so on

I love my friend and our relationship means a lot to me, and I would like to find a way to explore and deal with these complicated feelings.

If you have any recommendations - books, texts, online communities, etc, let me know!

autism,Wiredawn,2020/4/7,"How the inability to generalize is catastrophic to self-confidence. I'm not sure if this has been posted prior. If so, my apologies.

Currently, I'm in the last quarter of my graduate studies in public health; health policy, to be specific. As such, I'm often required to read and interpret absolutely insane amounts of scientific literature to piece together arguments, papers, and presentations. As an individual with autism spectrum disorder, this is a special kind of hell. I have a very limited ability to come to general conclusions from oceans of highly specific data, be it as simple as sensory data, or broad meta-analyses that synthesize conclusions from thousands of RCTs, C-RCTs, case-control, cross-sectional, prospective cohort/retrospective cohort study designs.

Suffice to say, my exclusion criteria is far, far, far broader than my inclusion criteria. Any request or requirement to generalize seems to me little better than if someone simply asked me to lie. 

Don't even get me started on how this affects me in my nascent search for employment. I often find that the moment I see a requirement within a job post for which I do not meet even one of the long list of the criteria, I immediately disqualify myself from the candidate pool. I do not know where the threshold is for me to actually reach a point where I would feel comfortable applying, but I would say if I don't meet 95% of the requirements in the job post, I bin my prospects. Anything less than that would, again, seem like I'm fabricating my qualifications.

I do not know where I'm going with this. Perhaps, I'm just reaching out to the community to see if this is a shared sentiment. I'm sure it can apply to many other areas (dating, anyone?). I think this has always been the biggest challenge for myself and this inability to generalize has been consistently inimical in my desire to bolster whatever shred of self-confidence I might possess. 

Hope everyone here is weathering the viral storm to their benefit. Much love."
autism,transautisticnc,2020/1/30,"Trauma, stimming, trust issues, therapy Just a sort of vent.

So I'm at the point where I see a lot of stuff in my life as traumatic. I was bullied and harassed as a child, in school, around town, at home. Nothing overly physical, except for the number of people who loved to try and rip my hair out. My family is very dysfunctional and became more so after parents divorced, lots of emotional abuse, body shaming, and every family member complaining to me about someone else expecting me to be on their side. Once I was 18 my mum moved abroad and so I didn't have these issues as constantly, but I've also had abusive experiences with housemates at university, and I've been around a lot of transphobes post coming out as non binary(yes including my family, they have endless resources for their weird bigotry).

Anyway, I never experienced something like ABA. Instead, I grew up in a house where my mum would easily flip on me for all kinds of shit - she projected her body issues on me, leading to some unhealthy eating habits which I suspect worsened my sensory processing issues in general, was constantly cooking or doing chores when at home and spent a lot of time visiting boyfriends etc, working extra jobs while I was alone(by this I mean multiple days of the week where she'd get back at 2am, spending sundays alone, in general I understand she was a single mum but the fact was she so obviously didn't want me around her), and so she was always in a bad mood around me. When we were shopping she would snap at me for dragging my feet. When I was at home she'd shame me for leaving any crumbs - and I mean, ANY. Eat one biscuit without a plate and she'd be pissed. The same went for loose hairs. She would tell me off for swallowing too loudly, biting my spoon while eating soup, and I'm having trouble with this still I think. I realised my meltdowns being more easily triggered when cooking goes wrong are related to how she would flip on me if I disturbed her while cooking. 

Anyway, alongside this she'd complain about my dad, who IS abusive, but as with the rest of my relatives, the way they would complain it was always focused on more obviously neurodivergent members of the family. My dad is obviously not neurotypical, he's also not in the best of states because he does not know how to take care of himself(he's a hoarder and the state of the house makes his asthma worse, despite him denying it I know because I would be unable to sleep there due to not being able to breathe) but he's also EXTREMELY ableist, and generally bigoted. When I told him I was gonna get an autism diagnosis, he basically said that because I'm a full human being and not some sort of subhuman, I can't be autistic. I am barely paraphrasing here. The trouble is, one of the lessons I got from this growing up was that if I was neurodivergent that made me more like him. I already have trouble feeling like people just see me as very neurotypical passing, even if I have shutdowns(I have lots of shutdowns without many meltdowns, and find them really frightening because I can't communicate with others and often find people ignore me while in them, which makes me dissociate and struggle to filter out sound because I rely on conversation to keep sensory issues at bay). I tend not to stim unless consciously doing so, even though it does help when I do it, and feel like I'm relying on a lot of stuff designed for allistic people to help me work through trauma, emotional dysregulation, shutdowns, etc.

Basically I have a shitload of issues including trust issues, and feel like therapy and stuff won't help because the therapist is almost always neurotypical, cisgender, assumes things about you from the way your body language is, about your emotions from your silence, from your expression, and I'm so tired of having people who are in no position to better analyse me than I can trying to guess how I'm feeling from these things. Even that time my old therapist was trying to comment on my expression by saying I was wearing more colourful clothes: how could she understand the tension between my wish to be accepted as predominantly male aligned, as someone who wants to be seen as male by strangers, the fact I'm also not straight, the bias towards femininity in a lot of LGBT+ spaces and how that clashes with my need not to be seen as a woman, she's cis. Not disparaging cis people needlessly here but it's just another example of how people in a majority think they have more worthwhile perspectives on a minority they're not a part of than they actually do, or could ever have without being in that minority. I went through that therapy periodically starting to feel like rebelling, just because I have spent a lot of time analysing myself and rarely does a therapist or counsellor tell me things which I didn't already think about myself. And I don't know how to deal with that sort of cynicism in the future because I need more support than close friends, but not if it comes from people expecting me to act cis and neurotypical. A lot of it also links with how people only started to suggest therapy or things to me when it was clear they wanted me to act ""normal"". So they wouldn't have to deal with my shutdowns or meltdowns or depressed moments because of gender dysphoria. Or reactions to abuse and misgendering and deadnaming and ableism.

My question to people who weren't diagnosed until later in life is what did your parents tell you that you were like when you were very young. It seems pretty obvious to me that my child is developmentally delayed, did your parents think or consider this at all when you were growing up? I am kind of amazed by the sheer number of people on this subreddit who have just realized that they are on the spectrum. I guess with my child he just seems very ""apparent"" to be on the spectrum.

I really want to eat better (less sugar, more protein and veggies). How do I find healthy foods that I can tolerate when it¡¯s extremely hard for me to find foods that I like in the first place? If I don¡¯t like how something tastes, I physically cannot eat it even if I try to force myself to or else I will throw up. Right now I have already significantly reduced the junk food I eat and limit myself to fast food once maybe twice a week, but I avoid it as much as I can (it¡¯s hard though!) I don¡¯t mind eating the same foods I have been eating, but I am going to start training at the gym to build muscle and I know the amount of food I eat (I usually end up not eating enough in the day) as well as the kind of food I eat won¡¯t help me reach my goal body. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

*I didn¡¯t mean to type out every single food I eat but I love making lists and I got carried away and wrote my entire personal menu, sorry!*

The foods I eat to give you an idea in case you are interested: yogurt, some fruits, some cereals, chicken noodle soup without chicken pieces in it but with added potatoes, boiled or mashed potatoes, chicken, hamburgers (I have been eating these less though), the occasional hot dog, French fries (no ketchup), turkey and cheese sandwiches, popcorn, lettuce, spinach, very rarely tomatoes, rice with beans, tortilla chips either plain, with salsa, or with guacamole salsa (sometimes I make shredded chicken nachos with lettuce, shredded cheese and beans), pb&amp;j occasionally, pork chops sometimes, avocados, fresh guacamole, boiled eggs, vegetable fried rice (only occasionally though because it comes from the Chinese food place), spaghetti, meatballs sometimes, fish filets very rarely (salmon and tilapia only, but I don¡¯t want to eat fish that much anymore because I don¡¯t support the fishing industry and how much plastic they put in the ocean), gummy fruit snacks, sometimes I eat cookies and cake and ice cream but I control those portions very well
Fast food: (I am also working on cutting out fast food for the most part and have greatly reduced the amount of times I eat out!) McDonald¡¯s (a mcchicken 99% of the time, a kids meal with nuggets the other 1%), Wendy¡¯s (a 4for4 with a burger and sweet and sour sauce for the nuggets), Subway (6¡± either ham or roasted chicken, with cheese, spinach, lettuce, green peppers, onions, and sweet onion sauce), Taco Bell (either 2 or 3 tacos with lettuce and hot sauce or a chicken quesadilla), and general convenience fast food is chicken tenders with honey mustard

autism,cleggzilla,2020/1/15,"We're really struggling and I don't know what to do from here. My son is 5, and was just diagnosed last month. I would like to share our story and hopefully get some feedback on where we can improve to help our little dude.
When Jude was 3 we tried putting him in daycare and he cried every day from 730 when i dropped him off until 445 when i picked him up, he was only in daycare for three weeks because it wasnt improving and we felt it was mean to make him keep going. The next year when we put him in pre-k he started having meltdowns before school everyday so we thought he maybe had anxiety, so we started taking him to therapy. His teacher was an angel and recognized the signs that he possibly autism because she had just recently gone through this with her child, so she knew how to help calm him and get him going for the day. When we brought up that we thought he may be autistic to his therapist, we found out that in our county in Georgia they do not do any sort of testing until they are at least 6, so we had to travel 3 hours away to get him evaluated. He has been on ability since we first started taking him tp therapy, but now it seems like its not working. He has had melt downs a few times over the past few weeks and he has only been to school three complete days over the last two weeks. We're looking into transferring him to a private school next year that has a program centered around people with autism so hopefully they can help, but i dont know what to do in the tine until then. If anyone has any suggestions or tips, please feel free to let me know. I honestly dont know how to help him at this point and it really makes me feel like I'm failing him as a father."
autism,lavender-slut,2020/1/15,"The use of colored lenses to deal with sensory overload I¡¯ve recently been thinking of different ways that I can cope with having light and visual overstimulation as it¡¯s something that¡¯s a very intrusive, uncomfortable part of my life. I came across the idea of colored glasses lenses because I already need to wear corrective lenses 24/7 so it wouldn¡¯t be too much of a jump to wear colored ones (Other than the fashion aspect of it lol). So I decided to do some research on how to go about deciding color and benefits or effectiveness of using colored glasses for this specific problem. I didn¡¯t really find anything of real relevance. 

However I did find one site that was aimed at a specific Brand of colored lenses that was made for Neuro-divergent people and more so autistic children for reading and difficulties in school based settings. The downside and ultimate reason why this is inaccessible to me is that the company requires money simply for a consult to determine if you¡¯d benefit from *their* specific color lenses.

My research hasn¡¯t really led me to anything other than this site and various ¡°color therapy¡± articles that are not necessarily based in science. So Reddit, I was wondering if any of y¡¯all have used or were thinking about colored lenses for dealing with visual sensory stimuli and your experiences/thoughts.

autism,Otterstripes,2020/3/17,"Melatonin It's usually hard for me to fall asleep, and I learned recently why that might be. Apparently it's not uncommon for autistic people to have issues sleeping, and apparently it's because some of us don't produce enough melatonin. 

I believe melatonin supplements are available at pharmacies near me as OTC medicines - if you've been taking melatonin at all, would you recommend it?"
autism,AryaStoleMyKill,2020/1/20,"Sick of seeing prejudice against autism (rant) Maybe it's just my area, and half the internet, but it seems like most people are vastly misinformed about autism and autistic people are suffering, and even dying, because of it. Worse, there doesn't seem to be much opportunity for change.

Are autistic people supposed to band together? How? They aren't visibly identifiable and have to remain unknown and try to blend in not to be bullied or outcast even as adults. Not to mention they don't tend to be clustered together like racial and religious groups can often be. You gonna gather together a bunch of easily overloaded people (who are pretty spread out to begin with) to march against riot cops? The standard courses of action in society fail entirely here. And before anyone starts any crap about NoT cArInG wHaT pEoPlE tHiNk, let's remember it has real world consequences when you can't get promoted, or get overloaded and lose your position, or can't get hired because the interview process can become too inhumane. Though people loathe to admit it (especially abusers), we are emotional machines, it takes a toll when everyone treats you badly. There are environments and tasks where autistic people actually thrive, and even outperform ""normal"" people, but they require treating your employee like a human who has feelings rather than a cog.  Then there's relationships. Mostly autistic people get to choose between people that will pity you but can't handle you for long, people who will take advantage of you, other socially unacceptable people (often with actual mental illnesses) or isolation, which they know plenty of and surely suffer psychological effects from. Add to all this an emotional system cranked to 11 and how is it even a puzzle that autistic people commit suicide at higher rates, and even die younger on average naturally? 

But hey, they're socially awkward, nobody likes that. You can't expect /everyone/ to change just to accommodate them, they need to fit in or screw 'em amirite? /s 

The change being asked for is an end to bullying of all kinds, at all stages of life, and equal opportunity based on merit of work rather than social skills. In my experience autistic people don't want to be socially awkward and welcome a certain degree of polite coaching. Nobody wants anyone to let the raging child take a bite out of anyone's leg except his Karen of a mother.  Also gonna go out on a limb and guess those holy terror children still get their fair share of abuse behind closed doors. If the parent is a total doormat they will likely let other abusive people into the household, and if not they probably wanna smack the kid too and probably do, which is not always as good of a learning tool as people hope. It can even make things worse, especially when you don't understand what you did wrong and just feel like your parents, teachers, and peers hate you for being born.

I saw a post that got an uncomfortable amount of traction, saying it should be ok to hate autistic people because of certain kids who aren't disciplined for violence, and it's their own fault for acting ""wrong"". But for every spoiled brat of an autistic child, whose parents can't figure out how to balance discipline and care and instead let the kid wreak unmitigated havoc, nobody seems to realize there are 10 who go their whole lives being pushed out of every opportunity and often abused heavily by family, friends, teachers, bosses, and coworkers because of ingrained social prejudices that are considered acceptable because ""It's how normal people know they can trust each other,"" and ""They're bringing it on themselves."" 

Except ""NORMAL"" PEOPLE CAN'T MAGICALLY TELL WHEN PEOPLE ARE TRUSTWORTHY, THEY JUST THINK THAT!  It's proven wrong constantly, every time a normal person trusts someone they shouldn't!   It has nothing to do with trustworthiness! It is a standard fear reaction to the unfamiliar, aka basic human prejudice. So even though autistic people are statistically more likely to be honest and trusting, to the point it often becomes the reason they get taken advantage of, their differences are used as an excuse to treat them like loose cannons who deserve to be denied every opportunity in life simply because they are socially awkward and ""I once knew a bratty autistic kid so my prejudice is justified"". Not to mention mommy's over-protection just translates to a lack of preparedness once adulthood rolls around, so yeah those kids are getting a huge advantage. /s

Also how the hell does anyone make the jump from ""They don't act the same,"" to ""They don't have feelings""? Pretty extreme assumption to make with ZERO EVIDENCE don't ya think? Nope, it's fine, just treat them like garbage, they can't feel anyhow. /s

For some other marginalized groups they say ""It gets better."" So far as I can tell, for autism it gets worse. I really wish it was easier to inform popular opinion. Unfortunately it is just that, popular, and autism is decidedly not. If you are an adult with autism who has a secure enough life that you can speak out, please do what you can to show people the other side to this. I know there are often gives and takes with it, and humanity would be worse off without some of the gifts it brings. Maybe with time they will learn that.

TLDR: THERE IS NO LOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR PREJUDICE AGAINST AUTISM. The stats don't match the popular sentiments. People who only deal with autistic problem children need to stfu and autistic adults need to be heard for public opinion to change."

autism,xrisdead,2020/1/4,"Can anyone corroborate this thought I had about autistic vs. normal emotions? Basically I think I have figured out how at least my autistic emotions are different from normal people's.

So we know the different areas of the brain are not connected properly in autism. The emotional part of the brain is not connected properly to all the rest of the parts of the brain either. However I think, at least in my case, the emotional part of the brain IS connected to whatever part is responsible for imagination.

I can be with someone and be fully present, and still not feel emotions/empathy properly. Later on when I think about what happened, I will feel the empathy and happiness, love etc.

I can feel some extreme emotions in the moment, such as anger which I used to get very often (large outburst vs just feeling angry and tense), and if I'm very close to someone I can feel something like love, I think. But there's no complexity there.

Maybe it is because in the imagination, emotions are more intense, which seems to be the case in some dreams. But not sure exactly why, I just feel that I do have the ability to feel emotions/empathy properly, it's just that maybe the conscious/aware frontal cortex is not connected to the emotional part well. And maybe there's some way to do that, like practising social things constantly and for long periods, not intermittently and for short periods, and imagining things very shortly after experiencing them?

Anyway, I'm wondering if anyone here can relate to this?

Addendum: I also realised something that backs this up, which is that I sometimes think about something I said, and think ""what made me say that?"" and usually also ""why did they react in that way?"". I realised just before that some things I say are motivated by emotions, and bring the emotions out in other people and help me connect with them, but I don't feel it. Why?  Because the emotional part is still working, although probably atrophied a bit, but it just isn't connected to the conscious part of the brain, which means that I say things without knowing what really motivated me to say it, and without understanding why the person reacted in such an emotional way.

It's like those people with the two halves of their brain disconnected who can react to and feel things happening in one side of their vision, and know what it is, but not actually be able to see it.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMLzP1VCANo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMLzP1VCANo)"

autism,gaywhip,2020/3/12,"universities priorities make no sense; coronavirus vs students with disabilities I am upset/angry. I have recently dropped out of university because I have been unable to deal with the sensory and social environments, as well as having terrible mental health. Since the coronavirus outbreak, the universities in my country have started online classes, they are recording lectures and uploading them etc. I hate that the second the neurotypical world is at risk, universities will do anything to help them, but here I am, an autistic dropout, who would have loved to have these services available to me when i needed them.

I hate it,and I hate the system. How does it take 2 weeks to change the way lectures are done for neurotypicals when people with disabilities have been asking for this forever? Why is it another way of showing that we are 'less than' or 'incapable'. There's a reason the dropout statistics are so high so why are they not changing the supports like they are with this outbreak? It doesn't make sense to me.

Sorry if this seems stupid, I guess I'm just disappointed. I would have loved to get through first year and my degree, and I'm just beginning to realise that I didn't because despite how much a university advertises its acceptance of autistic people, we will always be seen as less of a priority."

autism,bubblegum09,2020/2/3,"Disclosure without consent. Help? So this is my first post of this or any kind. Bear with me.

So I'm currently attending a college to obtain a qualification to work in aged care and disability. In the beginning we had one teacher who was willing to work with me and my diagnosis as I wanted to keep it quiet due to the nature of my course. The last three weeks we've had a substitute and again I deliberately and privately disclosed my diagnosis hoping to work with her. Within the first two days working with her she made numerous remarks about it being an excuse, claiming everyone has autism in someway and that if anything I'm better off for it, and justifying it by saying she has a daughter with autism I let it go as there was nothing I could do against her statements without proof. Last Friday however she sent an email disclosing my diagnosis and stating that I cannot touch people and no-one can touch me (an overly dramatic explanation that's to a large degree unture) to my placement facility without even notifying me. Now I've been volunteering at this facility for a year proving that I can do the job without the stigma associated and I'd wanted it to remain that way. I suppose what I'm wondering Is, Is there anything I can about the breach of privacy that has occurred here? Sorry for the long post."

autism,nevrevous,2020/2/3,"I don't like the term 'masking,' so I made a new analogy I always feel like the term 'masking' isn't quite right, because it makes it sound like there's a whole, fully functioning person under a completely different persona. I'm not sure if I can speak for everyone with this, but for me, I just feel like it's more similar to gloves.

I have hands. I can make all kinds of hand gestures, and different hand gestures can mean different things. For example, if you keep your hands in a fist or make sharp, quick hand gestures, it might show you're tough or excitable, and if you make flowing, graceful hand gestures or hold your hands together in front of your body it might show that you're elegant or posh. In this scenario, hand gestures represent emotions.

Obviously I feel all these emotions, but in some scenarios or with certain people, you need to show different emotions, or not show certain emotions, etc.

The same is with hand gestures in a way. You don't want to seem defensive in a casual conversation, and you don't want to seem casual in a professional conversation. So you put on certain gloves to boost certain gestures. 

Putting on lacy gloves boost gracefulness and politeness and professionalism, putting on leather biker gloves boosts confidence and toughness, putting on pink gloves with a cat design boost cheerfulness, childlike happiness and optimism. Wearing different gloves encourages you to use more appropriate gestures.

It's not like you never had these emotions in the first place, you have these emotions and you have these hand gestures. Just in some scenarios, you amplify certain ones, and the gloves just encourage that.

Does this kind sound more fitting for any of you or am I going the wrong way with this?"
autism,Daregmaze,2020/1/30,"''Reverse'' labeling I see many autistic people complaining about how they are labeled as being ''high functioning'' while they actually struggle as much the other person that is being labeled as ''low-functionning''.

Does anyone here would actually fit in that category? 

Im curious about this because, while it didn't happen that often that I got problems due to it, I do know that my ASD is more apparant than some others who people might assume are able to function indepedently while they aren't solely because they don't ''seem'' autistic. This is due to me being socially akward since I have trouble picking social cues, my weird demeanor, the fact that I stim sometimes amoungst few other things. Some of the people I know do agree that my autism is apparant. Yet, I am totally capable of living indepedently. I'm 110 percent positive that I will be able to hold a career and live on my own in the futur... but it still happened a few times that someone asked me if I would be able to live in an appartment some day."

autism,TheMuseCourt,2020/4/9,"How to Deal with Multiple Incompatible Needs [Looking for Advice] This is a problem I've been dealing with for years now but have never really known how to deal with. I live in a large family, eight in total, with a majority of us having different needs. I'm one of two diagnosed autistic dependents in the household, the other being non-verbal, along with several children with OCD, ADHD, and some that show traits of autism but haven't had a chance to be diagnosed. Even our parents show signs of autism and the like.

The problem is, everybody has different needs that usually conflict with one another. Some people are easily overstimulated and require quiet and calm, while others are often understimulated and need more noise and light to function better. Situations such as these leads to conflicts where neither person is in the wrong, but somebody has to give in and allow themselves to be uncomfortable (at the very least) or deal with meltdowns (at the most) so the other person can be happy. In such a tiny home with very little money, this can be very difficult to deal with, especially at times when leaving the situation isn't always an option.

So my question is, does anybody have advice on how to deal with these sorts of problems? How do you deal with incompatible needs? Thank you for your time, and I hope you all have an excellent day."
autism,DeiaFormica,2020/2/14,"I feel like a hypocrite. I'm really struggling with something and I need to know if it has to do with autism or not.

I am obsessive over only a few interests, but seemingly to the exclusion of all other potential interests. What I mean by this is that when other people talk about their interests, my listening center shuts down and my eyes glaze over. The real problem however, is that I feel the overpowering compulsion to share everything about my own interests at all times but I have little capacity to allow other people the same. I've tried forcing myself to listen to them, but its like my brain inserts distracting thoughts into my head until I'm sitting there like a corpse. If I had to describe what I feel in the situation, it's like this:

\-Person tells me about something

\-start feeling tired

\-start looking around, perhaps for an escape route

\-snap out of it and try to focus, but by now the speech sounds muffled and distant

\-intense images/smells/sounds/feelings start to invade my mind

\-get lost in a fantasy where fun and interesting things are happening

\-they leave because now I'm unresponsive (or get angry)

Keep in mind that during this process I can also be aware that I'm not listening to them, and yet I feel powerless to stop the unrelated thoughts from invading my head. Part of the frustration stems from feeling like I have no control over this behaviour, but also knowing intellectually that what I'm doing to another person is unfair. I feel like a hypocrite, and I don't know how to deal with this.

Is this something that can be worked on? If so, how?"

autism,meanyapickles,2020/3/27,"Any advice on how to help my younger brother (on the spectrum) with his reading homework? My younger brother is high-functioning, but he has auditory sensory issues which are quicky triggered when/if our dog starts whining or making noise. He had an IEP at his last school and is prone to anxiety that can build to anxiety attacks and outbursts if not quelled.

With Covid-19 and my younger brother doing online school, I'm the one mostly helping him with his homework. I'm ashamed to say I feel frustrated because his difficulty with certain assignments is NOT his fault, but I really want to help him and I just don't know how to get the information he's reading through to him.

Reading is one of his least favorite things to do so he gets extremely anxious whenever the task presents himself. It's like, he reads the words on the screen, but their meaning doesn't quite *click* if that makes sense. He reads the words but isn't absorbing and understanding what they mean.

I can understand doing a minimalist job on homework because high school is super annoying, but when given assignments where he has to answer questions about a reading project, he just repeats whatever his reading says word-for-word if he can which does him no good when the questions start asking him for his opinions and interpretations about the article.

Has anyone ever had this problem, either the person trying to help or the one who has trouble with reading/comprehension? What's worked for you if anything? Any advice is appreciated."

I had an assessment a few weeeks ago to diagnose ADHD - I came back as having enough symptoms to diagnose me with combined ADHD (inattentive + hyperactive), but they couldn't rule out autism as a better explanation, and as such have referred me for a second assessment with an expert in autism. For me, this is frustrating, as I have waited over a year since referral for the ADHD assessment - and I don't think I have autism, at least not to the extent that it would explain the difficulties I had attributed to ADHD. 

The symptoms they listed as suggestive of autism make sense to me; lack of empathy, difficulty reading facial expressions, troubles keeping friends, routines, thinking imaginary play was silly when I was younger. I used to really struggle with making eye-contact but always attributed it to anxiety, and now I make really prolonged eye contact.

I have received various occupational, speech, and psychological talk therapies in order to make my condition manageable and to avoid being mistreated by society through my ""quirks"". Throughout middle school, I had issues making friendships and even maintaining conversations due to you know what. In high school particularly, I had people call me mean terms because of being on the spectrum. In high school, this blatant and explicit form of mistreatment changed to more subtle, implicit, and low-key forms of exclusion. People ignored me, not invited me to events, said bad things about me behind my back, etc.

I tried suppressing or blocking out these traits in order to ""pass off"" as a neurotypical individual out of fear of being treated poorly. While it worked well and I experienced no dissonance due to this  change, whenever I visited this online forum, ([https://wrongplanet.net](https://wrongplanet.net)) about individuals living on the Autism Spectrum, I got harsh criticism for attempting to ""pass as neurotypical"" or ""appease to the able-normative demands of respectability politics"".

autism,markko79,2020/4/10,"I can't imagine my life as a normal person I'm a 59 year old male with a mild case of autism... just enough to interfere with interpersonal communication and dealings.  I also have trouble understanding other people's verbal communication and intentions at times.  After reading an article describing adult autism, I visited an adult autism specialist at age 45.  I discovered I had autism and ADHD.  Well... suddenly all of the socialization problems I had up until then made sense.

During my second grade standardized testing, I scored at the 8.2 grade level in areas like reading comprehension, language skills, map reading, math, and so on.  The teachers thought there was a scoring error, so they retested me.   I scored at the 8.4 grade level on the second test.  I should have been placed in a special group, but none existed in my school district.  So I remained in age-based grades through high school.  Elementary school was OK, but I was bored most of the time, which led to some behavior problems.  Junior high and senior high school was excruciating and stressful; the classes were fine.  I just hated dealing with my fellow students and their cliques and the jocks and drug use and everything.

All of the teachers knew I was quirky and different, but there were no diagnostic tests available in the mid-1960's to diagnose me.  Some wanted to place me in special education, but realized the school district's only special education classes were reserved for intellectually impaired kids.

Early on, I knew my sports skills were poor due to awful eye-hand coordination. Phys Ed was my worst class throughout the grades.  I absolutely hated Phys Ed classes.  I liked dodgeball for a while, but quickly discovered I was an easy target for the other team and a poor ball thrower for my own team.    I was always the last one picked to be on a team, which was humiliating and demeaning. 
 When that happened, any smidgen of enthusiasm that I had disappeared.  With a little encouragement from my parents, I tried to play Little League baseball, but quit after two weeks.  The other kids taunted me relentlessly for my poor batting and ball catching skills.

I had a handful of friends, but never participated in traditional sports with them. However, we made up and played elaborate outdoor games like one called Trail.  Trail was a running game where one team of kids would be chased around town by a second team as dictated by a set of rules.  A game of Trail could easily last four hours and require ten miles of running.

I was in junior and senior high school band and held the ""1st chair, 1st trumpet"" position. I was also in the marching band; somehow, I found marching easy.  That was my best and favorite class.  I also participated in music competitions and won several awards for the school.

I found early on as a kid that I had a knack for electrical skills and biology/health care. I intensely studied those disciplines on my own. I aced biology, physics, chemistry, and shop classes. I wired my first new house at age 14; it passed the electrical inspection on the first try and required no rework.

I became an Emergency Medical Technician at age 17 while in high school and formed a new ambulance service at age 18. I procured a 1976 Cadillac ambulance and found 25 volunteers to take the EMT course. I recently retired from that ambulance service after 38 years of service, which included roles as chief, assistant chief, policy writer, infection control officer, preceptor, field paramedic, and critical care registered nurse. That ambulance service is now licensed at the critical care level and has four modern intensive care ambulances, 4 full time critical care paramedics, 20 part-time critical care paramedics and nurses, and a handful of basic EMTs.

My social skills are still awkward, which makes new people (and patients) wonder if there's something mentally wrong with me. As I interact with them, they soon realize that I'm just quirky.

autism,silverwillowgreen,2020/1/12,"(Advice) Needing reassurance from an occasionally nonverbal partner My partner is on the spectrum, and often has long periods where they are mostly nonverbal and are overwhelmed by touch. We have been dating for two years, so you'd think I'd be used to it by now, but due to my intense anxiety and (managed but still present) codependency issues, when they are having nonverbal days, it sends me into a panic. I assume they are angry or upset, when they simply don't have the energy to talk. 

I ask what's wrong, they say 'nothing', and it's hard to get an answer out of them about whether or not they are feeling nonverbal, obviously, because they are feeling nonverbal. I usually just need a few words of reassurance when they are in this mood, because I need to know whether they are mad or just not feeling words. But it's difficult for them and it's a lot of effort.

We've reached an impasse on this issue, and are planning on going to couples therapy soon. I was wondering if anyone had any short term solutions for us. We need to figure out a way that my anxiety can be calmed, while they also don't have the energy to communicate. 

Also if anyone has any advice for me on how to better handle these moments of limited communication and physical contact, it would be highly appreciated."

autism,kspharm,2020/3/17,"Our experience with sensory overload, SIB/headaches and seizures Hi all, first time posting here and hope this might help someone else who's had to deal with something similar.
Our son is 8, diagnosed at 18 months with ASD. He's nonverbal and has dealt with GI issues his whole life (mostly severe constipation, controlled with miralax).
About 3 years ago, he started having unexplained acute episodes of pain; due to the GI history and him being unable to communicate to us where it hurt, we wound up doing an endoscopy (2 of them actually) and colonoscopy to no avail. Wound up putting him on a dairy free diet which didn't help. 
About 2.5 years ago he started self injuring when these episodes would happen; we noticed that he was hitting his head a lot and took him to his neurologist and got an MRI under sedation. Results showed nothing out of the ordinary, and neurologists didn't prescribe anything.
He's always been sensitive to noise but over the last 2 years it progressively got to the point where he was plugging his ears almost 24 hours a day, including while asleep. The pain episodes could be triggered by birds chirping or just a gust of wind.
The pain kept increasing and we tried everything we could think of including CBD oil and medical THC with no response. Ibuprofen and Tylenol helped a little bit.
About 3 months ago the pain started becoming debilitating; he was having an episode almost every 1-2 hours. He was banging his head so hard on the ground that he split his forehead open multiple times. We decided to go back to the neurologist again, but before we could make it to the appointment he had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure for the first time. 
This was a bit over a month ago and he's had several more since; he was started on Depakote (valproic acid) in the hospital and we've been adjusting the dose trying to get in the right range. Good news is no seizures for more than 10 days now. 
The absolute most incredible thing is that the pain episodes are almost completely gone on the Depakote. His neurologists told us the drug is used for migraines in addition to epilepsy. The only time they came back was a few days before he had seizures again - and his drug level was not in range when it happened.
The drug can have really serious side effects and you must get lab work done while on it, and it definitely isn't for everyone (lot's of people cannot tolerate it). I'm not at all suggesting to put your child on it, for us we just couldn't figure out where the pain was coming from and this confirmed it was neurological. For us and our situation, the drug has been life changing; I am praying that he can stay on it without severe side effects.
We were at our wits end with our child and feeling helpless and hopeless; unfortunately it took the onset of epilepsy to figure out what was going on. I'm not advocating for anything, but I just wanted to share our story in case it might help"

I¡¯m a high functioning autistic person who is in the LGBTA community as well as some fandom communities. It¡¯s a common thing in some of these places (like on Twitter or Tumblr) to keep note of people in the community who have done wrong/creepy things and when they did such things.

I understand the intent of these things- to make the community safer and less racist/transphobic/sexist/predatory-, all of which I am fully behind and I¡¯m not arguing about the necessity of it, but I feel like I am lagging behind all of my friends in being able to pick up on red flags or warning signs that everyone else seems to intuitively know about.

It leaves me feeling like I¡¯m MUCH lower functioning, that my previous perceptions of my ability to communicate are wrong, and is starting to convince me that everyone I interact with is trying to manipulate me.

I feel like this plays into my autism- an inability to read proper tone or intent in people makes it hard to know who is malicious and who is not-, but I don¡¯t know how to navigate the online world and communities when everyone has a low tolerance for trying to fill me in or explain it to me.

So, I thought I would reach out in case anyone else has a similar scenario: Has this sort of thing happened to anyone else? Is there a way to learn to know what to avoid?

autism,AlmightyStrawberry,2020/3/14,"(School/College) So is it procrastination after all...? I want your insight r/autism

I'm currently working on my thesis and got overflown by an intense hatred for a couple of my freshman year classmates but also again a lot of doubt about myself.

To cut a long story short (and also leaving out some of my faults such as chronic tardiness): I was in a group project that among others were dead-set on working in the campus cafeteria. I'm majoring in Social Work so I was kind of taken aback with the reactions my classmates gave me after I explained to them that sorry, there are so many sounds here that I simply can't follow what they were saying and it was also really tiring for me, suggesting to get the food and move to a nearby quieter area.

""Can't you put more effort into blocking other people out and just listening to us? Kind of unfair of you to expect us to adapt so much to you.""
I'm not going to go further into this because I had a feeling, and was confirmed in this, that no, it is actually not okay for an aspiring social worker to guilt your potential coworker with a disability to bend over backwards and have them underperform just because you want some extra comfort at work. A bit overdramatic what I'm saying but honestly, if my coworkers were excluding a deaf social worker by transfering information via spoken word only because typing 'is too much work' (and also get angry at the deaf coworker), nowadays I'd be tearing them a new one.


But I'm here because of the following. I've always had this problem, ever since I got homework: I honestly wouldn't know on my own what parts of the material are important to know and which aren't. This included attempts in grade 7 to memorize tables with completely irrelevant information.

I had a lot of trouble in freshman year especially to keep deadlines and the feedback I got from classmates was always: ""You need to stop procrastinating and start earlier."" When I explained that I really didn't know how to tackle this problem as I legitimately started writing my part of the project as soon as I got home every day and in the weekends but found it hard to get a clear picture of what I was supposed to write (coupled with for instance my suggestion to plan our project ahead for the coming 5 weeks which was rebuffed as 'let's not work too far ahead, we'll work per week'), I was told to stop making excuses for myself.


Has anyone experiences with the trouble I have separating the details from the more important stuff? I also notice that I start a task but even after having read the instructions I always come at a point in the task where I feel like I need to start anew. Do you know what to do about it? I'm getting help now for this problem but so far they couldn't help explain the problem further other than me having major difficulties seeing what's relevant and what's not."

I've finished high school and am putting together a scholarship application to a film school that requires a written portion and a showreel of my high school films. Getting the scholarship would mean my parents saving thousands and thousands of dollars so I obviously understand that it's very important.

I was reasonably motivated coming out of high school, but I recently dislocated my knee, and so have been more or less immobile at home while I recover and the boredom has been making me pretty miserable a lot of the time, so my motivation isn't there so much anymore.

Just earlier I apologised to my Mum for my lack of enthusiasm, and I suppose I was hoping for an ""I understand"" type response, but she said ""Well you'll have to make yourself enthusiastic because it's important"". And the thing is, I know what she said is absolutely correct, but the negative nature of the encouragement just didn't sit well with me. And I think that's how I was through school as well. I just don't get any kind of good feeling out of that sort of reinforcement. It just makes me feel like the person is already mad at me and I don't think it helps me.

So I just thought like, is this actually a bad way to motivate me or am I just overly sensitive and can't handle an honest push?

I¡¯m just wondering if anybody here has any experience with nonverbal autism being mixed with schizophrenia?
What symptoms were present, and how did you go about getting a diagnosis? 
What techniques have proven useful in helping a nonverbal person with schizophrenia when they have been manic?
Post-diagnosis, what medications have worked in the management of this?
I am asking as I believe I know a nonverbal person who may be experiencing this, however I need to do some more research before pushing through with this route.

autism,doomflcn,2020/2/4,"Looking for travel advice My parents, years ago decided they wanted to take all of their grandchildren on trips to wherever they wanted to go all over the world when the kids reached 12. So far my 4 nephews and one of my daughters have all been able to go to England and Spain and Italy at their choice for these two week trips and aside from a little homesickness there hasn¡¯t been much of a hitch. 
My 11 year old autistic son is coming up on 12 and we are trying to work out his trip and what he wants to do and where he wants to go and we are having issues with my dad, his grandpa. He wants to put restrictions on where my boy can go because he thinks international travel might pose some serious problems for a kid with autism who is traveling with his grandparents. Specifically he seems to have heard horror stories from somewhere about people traveling with autistic kids who have become separated at customs or immigration in foreign countries because of some behavior of the autistic child. 
We are not really sure what he means by this exactly and he doesn¡¯t seem to be able to give examples, just that things escalate and that customs agents are not understanding and everyone gets separated and interrogated. He uses an example from when our daughter went on her trip and my mom got separated from them going through us customs because of a luggage hiccup and my daughter got a little panicky as something that he thinks my boy might not be able to handle. 
So I¡¯m looking for some advice. I know from his pediatrician that we can get him some accommodation in the US, but we really know next to nothing about anywhere else. He wants to go to England he thinks, so I guess what I¡¯m asking is: does anyone have experience traveling to or from England with a child who is on the spectrum and are there any accommodations we can request or anything we should know? Any resources anyone can point me to that I can use to potentially sway my dad? Or just general air travel with autism advice?

Sorry for the long post and I apologize if this doesn¡¯t belong here. 

TLDR: my dad is inexplicably freaking out about taking my autistic son through customs in a foreign country (England) and I need help to fix it."

autism,thepizzadeliveryguy,2020/4/18,"Stimming in my dreams for first time I've only recently started to realize that I'm autistic after masking it my entire life. I've always stimmed, but, it was either only when I was alone or a modified ""fidgety"" version of it when around people. Even when I was alone, I was never really fully conscious of it. It was just ""some weird stuff I do when I'm alone"", even though it was really pronounced and would look quite stereotypical to an outside observer. 

As I've recently learned more about autism and started coming to terms that those traits actually fit me quite well, I've become almost eerily aware when I'm stimming. It's always just been something I did unconsciously. I've recently had dreams where I stim the way I do when I'm alone but in public. It's really interesting to me. It's like my subconscious mind is trying to integrate the side of myself I've been repressing with my more social ""masking"" personality that people know me by. 

I doubt I'll stim quite that hard in public, but, I've noticed myself doing more and more ""authentic"" stims here and there around people I trust. Before now, I've always just sort of squirmed a bit and rubbed my hands or shook my leg up and down with almost imperceptible rocking when in public. I'd also just look around a lot while rolling my head around. If anyone seemed to notice, though, I'd stop and tense up.

autism,spooniextubie,2020/1/2,"I went outside alone for the first time after 5 months isolation Hi,  23 yo female, depression, autism and social anxiety disorder.

I've been incredibly sick the past few years. Got wheelchair bound, several complications from my type 1 diabetes, not able to walk anymore and it messed with my structure a lot.

I got diagnosed with depression / anxiety disorder 5 years ago and got it under control with exposure therapy, medication and lots of structure. In 2019 things got out of hand physically which made me undergo multiple surgeries, hospital nights and eventually bed-bound for quite a time. 5 months ago it was the last time I went outside by myself. Being isolated for so long (living on my own) felt terrible, yet comfortable. Eventually I got used to being alone and isolated which lead to not being bored anymore, learned to ''entertain'' myself and got some studies done online, also began the first pages of writing for my own book. When I got a bit better again and was able to leave the bed for a couple of hours a day, it was hard to get used to the again new structure. I caught myself eventually on being terribly afraid of going outside. My anxiety got out of control, leading to me hyperventilating, sweating and throwing up out of fear by just trying to open my door. All this time my caregivers went out to get groceries n such for me, the other supplies I constantly ordered online. The fear of going outside made me unable to think healthy and unable to leave my house at all.

Last week, a trusted caregiver of mine came to talk with me. He saw I was doing awfully (mentally speaking) since I didn't bring up any of my interests, hobbies and art anymore. When talking with him, I realized that my anxiety was choking me and telling me lies. We took it step by step and went outside for 10 minutes together. Just sitting in front of my apartment complex, taking some deep breaths of fresh air while talking about my pets. We went inside again after a little while, and I wrote down everything I enjoyed while being outside (even though it was for a short time). 

Today, after one of my rabbits got surgery, I realized that I had to go to the store to buy some blankets and veggies so my rabbit could recover a bit more easier. I had two choices: calling my caregivers to fix the job, or getting my handbike and wheelchair and go myself. After writing a grocery shopping list, doing my breathing-exercises, and seeing my poor bunbun in pain, I went. I went outside, and I enjoyed every single moment. Although I was a bit anxious and tensed, I got everything from my shopping list. I went to the store, had contact with other humans and now my bunbun is warm, eating her veggies and cuddling up to me.

Sorry for the long post, I just feel really proud after a terribly long time of being numb. I feel proud that I didn't let my demons win, and that I am able to be proud of myself again :)"

Maybe it has to do with other psychological problems I'm facing, but I feel lost. 

I've felt myself slipping away into complete mutism, because anytime I talked about something I was always told to be quiet. It's become quite clear to me that nobody wants to hear what I have to say. Only a couple of years ago when I met a couple of younger students at the school I was attending did I actually want to talk and discuss things again. Games, video's, books, identities even.  Students my age didn't want to talk with me, and, thankfully, the teachers understood this and allowed me to work alone most of the time. I only ever talked with that small group of students.

I've since left that school and the group behind, and I've had barely any time to do anything about my interest. I have forgotten what I was passionate about. I don't know what I can be passionate about without being told to shut up, being interrupted, being talked over of flat out ignored.

It could also be because of the lack of support and constant criticism from everyone around me that caused me to lose my interest in my interest. I can vaguely remember some subjects, but I don't know what I was passionate about anymore. Currently a student at a technical university, I don't feel understood, and I want to be able to focus on something special to me. I hope it may calm me down in times of distress, such as the upcoming two month long period of being forced to work in groups with people I have never properly met before.

""developmental class"". now, i can't imagine myself as an elementary school student waiting in a bus stop because i had to get on a smaller bus that's full of low-functioning autistic kids i barely know (i still ride this bus until around 11th grade). and also, i was just wondering why autistic people had zero personality compared to the non-autistic people on the regular bus. now, let's move on to another annoying thing about autism, their lack of handling constructive criticism. for example, in r/autism, the users' scores are hidden, which means they refuse to allow their number of downvotes being shown on here. and even worse, when you want to downvote something, a message pops up saying ""Please reserve your downvotes for off-topic comments and submissions."". WTH? the point of downvoting is so you can show your dislike for a comment or a submission, not for something that is off-topic! and finally, let's talk about the probably-least disadvantages when it comes to autism, the shows autistic people watch. most of the time, the watch shows for little kids like ""Thomas the tank engine"", ""My little pony: Friendship is magic"", and, probably the most shocking of all,""Paw patrol"". frickin' Paw patrol! that show is a nick jr. show and yet, the autistic fanbase  take the show one step beyond by having an adult fanbase, draw crabby fan art, and even go as far as acting like a baby. i'm not even joking, there are some frickin' Paw patrol fans who act like babies! i know this may not be about autism, but still! well, just goes to show you how bad autism can be. and that, my ""friends"", which i don't have, is my thoughts on autism."

autism,solitary-soul,2020/3/15,"Eye contact and thinking in pictures I was having dinner with some friends the other night, and one of them (a neurotypical, as far as I¡¯m aware) mentioned that he didn¡¯t know where to look when the waitress was reciting from memory the lengthy list of specials; he was unsure how much eye contact is appropriate, and he was trying to maintain the delicate balance between appearing moderately interested versus seeming disrespectful and dismissive.

As an expert in being awful at eye contact, I chimed in and explained that in order to even understand what she was saying, I needed to look away so that I could visualize what she was saying instead of focusing on whether I¡¯m doing eye contact appropriately. This seemed to confuse him, and I elaborated that as she described each dish, my mind had to create an image of each item in order to process the information. I also explained, as an example, that when she mentioned veal, the image that my mind presented to me was a cute baby cow, not actually a cut of meat (I have a moral opposition to eating veal, but that¡¯s another story).

I¡¯ve read that it is common for autistic people like myself to think in pictures. So that makes me wonder, how do neurotypicals think? Do they not see imagery in their mind as they process thoughts? What do they see? Words? A vast, empty nothingness? I¡¯m having a hard time wrapping my head around this.

This may be the exact incorrect place to ask this question, but I¡¯m hoping that maybe someone here can explain. I do plan to bring this up for discussion with my friend a some point, but I¡¯m not yet comfortable with openly discussing my autism."
autism,multiverse4,2020/3/9,"Hope this is an appropriate sub for this question - looking for advice on potentially integrating an autistic team member into a work project Hello!
This was a bit tough to summarize in the title, and I hope this is 1)the right place to ask and 2)not offensive/please please tell me if I¡¯m not using the right vocabulary or thinking about this the right way!

I work at a (very large) company that has a program for integrating autistic young adults into certain roles (think computer program debugging type things). This is not volunteer work - the pay is standard, publicly available, and the same whether the worker is autistic or not. 

My own department doesn¡¯t usually absorb people through this program. However, we have begun a project that requires us to sort through and label an enormous amount of data. It¡¯s a very mundane, repetitive task and the amount of data means I could easily sit here for the better part of a year doing nothing but that and not be done. 

It has come up that this might be a good task to bring in someone from the autistic program, because there is a stereotype that many people with autism are good at/enjoy repetitive tasks. 

So I would like to ask - does this sound like an appropriate thought process? Is this just a stereotype or are there in fact a significant portion of people that would enjoy such a task?

And if it is a good direction, could you please give me some tips for integrating the person that comes into the team? Some common pitfalls? Things you wish your bosses knew? Things to do, things to avoid? Anything else you think might be helpful in terms of making our department a happy place for our potential new employee?

Thank you in advance!"

This mostly happened because a fair number of people on the server are neurodiverse and we were talking about how easy it is to relate to neurodiverse people even if we are seemingly neurotypical.

Anyways thats not really important but basically one of my friends shared a quiz (that they apparently trust) that could like be interesting. so thats basically where this started. Honestly i think im like hyperfixating on this right now and i feel like i have to make this post ASAP and idk why.

autism,mervasos,2020/2/22,"How to get close to my autistic brother? Hello everyone. 

I'm a 24 year old guy with a 23 year old brother with highly functioning autism. Throughout my childhood I felt sad about the fact that me and my brother were so close agewise, yet so far apart in our relationship. Due to my brother's lack of social interest and different way of behaving, we never really bonded and have never had a real friendship. Our talks are always short (a few sentences exchanged) and mostly about movies, which is pretty much the only common interest we share.

Now that my brother has become more mature, I feel like he is really making an effort to strike up conversations and interacting more socially. This has moved me and I have found a new love for my brother, as I feel like he actually cares about our relationship. I am trying to build a relationship to my brother, but I know that social interacting can be difficult for people with autism. So my question is, how can I develop a better relationship with him? I feel sad for him sometime since he has no friends or girlfriend and he has dealt with some depression. Over the last few years I have really enjoyed being with him, since he seems to be more interested and not just aloof on his computer like he used to. I have invited him to the movies and bowling sometimes and this is a activity that we enjoy, since we don't need to hold a conversation and can just enjoy the activity together. How can I know if my brother likes doing these things, or if he would perhaps rather be alone (since social interaction is difficult) or should I keep trying to bond and develop a friendship? If so how do I make this enjoyable for him?"

autism,12crowsinatrenchcoat,2020/2/6,"A nice story about allistics standing up when we can't So when I came into second block, the teacher had moved some desks around (we have assigned seating). I found the desk with my name on it, but just as I was dropping my stuff down, a girl who already has a history of being aggressive about ""asking"" to borrow computers and see answers plonked her stuff down at my desk and walked off to go to the bathroom. All I managed to get out was a sheepish ""Uh, that's my desk"" and she practically barked back, saying ""Well I don't care, I don't have time to argue about desks."" 

I just kinda stood there in shock and with no idea what to say while she walked off. Immediately a couple people around me were like ""wtf, that was rude"" and I was practically on the verge of tears because so much of the bullying that happened for my entire childhood was like this, and here I was, foolish enough to think it would stop when we all got older and more chill. 

But then the girl whose desk was next to the first girl's desk spoke up. ""What the hell, that was so rude, I can't believe she talked to you like that. Honestly, just move her stuff and sit down because she doesn't have any right to treat you like that. And when she comes back, if she to tell you anything or do anything, I'll vouch for you."" 

That was the nicest thing anyone in this godforsaken school district had ever said to me, and I let her know it. (And if you're wondering about what happened after, the first girl had to be relocated to an entirely different room because she had to make up the test she missed on the day that the teacher moved the desks.)"

It has voice navigations to direct you from your current location to your destination and a simple user interface. What makes it different from other maps is that it can show the noise levels of different types of noise around you (there is a button that lets you choose the type of noise) and create a route that is the shortest AND the quietest, so you can travel at ease. The app is still in the process of development, so we would like to know how much the app could help you. (Of course, it is also available for the general public). 

We are also planning to add checkpoints on the route to make sure the user is on track and allow parent monitoring if necessary. A reward system is also in consideration to encourage users to keep going. Thanks for reading this and have a great day!"

Between being autistic and a trans woman, I get messaging that I am an unwanted or unfortunate outcome. I remember how the world treated me before I could mostly hide those things, and how it does when they come up.

I have always felt a pressure to be perfect in my academics and career development, to be a ""good kid"" and rule follower. To be very smooth and likeable, more than even most NTs. To be pretty, perfectly dressed with makeup, and maintain a nice figure. I do benefit from and enjoy some of those things, but a part of me feels a need to be perfect to be accepted or be safe and drives my perfectionism to extremes.

autism,regrettingall,2020/4/13,"I eventually shut down while talking about special interests- is this normal? Some context- I'm not very good at emotional regulation, I feel things very much to the point where I just shut down and can barely communicate. And my special interests are incredibly niche- I enjoy world building and character making, but only if I can talk about my own creations. I've also had a lot of negative responses to special interests, so I can't bring myself to talk about them very often, that might factor into it.

I can have two responses when talking about my special interests, which is extreme excitement that someone is actually listening to me, or devastation that I'm being brushed off. So while talking about special interests, I'm overwhelmed by emotion and either way, end up shut down or at least unable to communicate.

autism,FrancisScottKeyboard,2020/3/29,"COVID Shutdown and Executive Dysfunction I theorize that at times in the last month, my E.D. has lessened due to the state of society at present. Setting aside those who are ignoring the rules, most people on the whole planet for the time being must, by force, accomplish less of their plans, respond to less of their motivations on a daily basis than otherwise they would. This creates a scenario wherein, in a sense, humanity as a whole is moving somewhat more slowly than it has for decades or more.   


This slower way of life for many is far more in tune with the way I think/process information/strategize. Ergo, I am somewhat more on the same wavelength of progress as the rest of society is, all be it temporarily. The latent pressure to ""hurry up and get something done,"" is not as palpable worldwide for the average person. The result? I feel I am able to reach decisions or take steps in a direction in less time than I would have before this COVID isolation mess. The phantom competition with how the world expects me to think, (especially in the American Protestant Work Ethic mode) is further away. So I get more done with my mind.  


Of course, it isn't a total cure for certain executive function problems. And it is only a theory about a once in a lifetime situation. But with less of a certain type of ""noise"" in the world, I almost feel I can hear myself think, and sort things out a bit more now.

Against the recommendations of my teachers, my parents refused to put me in special education or get me accommodations was I was younger (instead, my dad would come home from his 12-hour work days and tutor me). My mother was intensely concerned with my intelligence and social acumen and did not respond well when when she thought I was doing poorly (""the most abusive parent I've ever seen"" ¨C a therapist). I never received anything lower than an A- before college, and I spent all of my time at school either in class or studying alone in a room. I transitioned from wearing earplugs only while studying to also when walking around (it was glorious! people stopped talking to me! I can't describe the elation of walking around and not having to hear people. But I stopped in college because I'm trying to be better lolol...). 

I now attend a top institution, and I feel constantly besieged even though I have a statistically medium-high GPA. I don't have accommodations, because, in my mother's words, ""the real world doesn't have accommodations,"" and because so many resources have been put towards my academic success that I feel like accommodations would be a sign of my own personal failure.

I thought that I was at the point in my academic career where I could circumvent my LD (I chose a discipline that does not require rapid-fire cognition), but this exam made me feel like it really came back to bite me. To boot, I am a strongly-opinionated and somewhat combative woman raised by an army brat, and I am convinced that everyone other than my SO hates my personality despite the hours of thought per day I put towards trying to fix it. When I have a full-time job and enough money, I want to go to therapy to figure out how to be likeable so I can live with myself and be a good employee.

This has been a rant! Thank you for reading! If anyone has any suggestions for how I should move forward, please share!"

autism,_St_Echo,2020/2/2,"Brother (15y/o) on the spectrum and becoming more withdrawn... I have a younger brother who is 15 and is autistic, adhd, dyslexic, with anxiety. He is very high functioning but has always had a hard time with communication and expression. In many cases he won't respond to people talking to him or asking him things and doesn't always make it known that he is even listening. I know for anyone, that age is also tough just having to grow up and combined with what he deals with, it can be very overwhelming. He is really the sweetest kid but seems so angry sometimes and I know a lot of that is from the stress of not being able to express himself or understand how he's feeling, and also from dealing with school which is never fun or easy for him. 

He does have an IEP and goes to a social class once a week outside of school, and sees a therapist, but I feel like he needs more. He went to occupational therapy when he was younger, but nothing right now. I think it would be great if he could go to something (along the lines of occupational therapy) but for communication, expression, and also food therapy as he only really eats the same non-nutritional thing everyday. I've tried to look up what might be available, but haven't found anything in my area (Massachusetts). Not sure if anyone would know of a type of therapy or something that might be a good step to take or look into?

I just am worried since he is becoming so withdrawn and any attempts we make to talk to him or get him to open up, he just gets angry and withdraws further. I'm also concerned since he is getting older about how he will cope in the real world, with possibly getting a job or starting to drive etc. 

All help and suggestions are appreciated. I'm sure there are a lot of details I've left out, don't want to make this too long."

i apologize if this is the wrong place to ask this, but im writing a research paper for my school regarding the (mis)representation of mental illness and the stigma that follows it and i thought i could get some real and personal views and answers to this topic.

We have to get a few specific examples and i was thinking about including the role of Sheldon Cooper from the Big Bang Theory, mainly because he is widely recognized as some sort of ""autism mascot"".

So my question is, how do you feel about how autism is represented in the show? Are you able to identify with Sheldon Cooper? Or is it just harmful represantation, reinforcing the already existing stigma surrounding autism? And if yes, how could it be improved?

autism,blacknwhitedog,2020/1/27,"Advice needed about ASD son and his college entry (UK) Hi all, just wanted to ask if anyone had experience of this either as a parent or a child.

We are in the UK. My son is 15, has been diagnosed with ASD since he was 3, and has been in mainstream education all his life. With a few bumps and rocky patches, he has successfully navigated the english educational system and is predicted very high grades for his gcse's.

Now comes to the problem. He has an interview this evening at the sixth form college he wants to go to. He has told me he doesn't want to disclose his autism to the college. When we filled his application form in he chose to say he would discuss medical issues at the interview. 

His point of view is that he knows that people treat him differently once they know he is autistic. He wants the chance to start at a new place with noone having preconceived notions about him due to his ASD. The courses he wants to do will be filled, i think, with students like him, so i don't think he will have problems fitting in(further maths/computer science/programming). It's unlikely that any other students from his school will be going to this particular college.

My point of view is that it is extremely difficult to get support in place once a problem is identified, and he should disclose so that the structure is there ready for him him IF he needs it.

I just don't think he is ready to go it alone just yet. He still struggles with long assignments that are not broken into pieces for him. He needs extra time in certain exams (the ones that are not Q&amp;A).

I don't want to really go against his wishes, he is learning to be an adult and should have some autonomy over his medical and educational decisions, but at the same time, I am his mum and have been battling for 12 years to get the support he has needed and been using during his childhood.

I have recently been diagnosed with ADHD myself, and would always prefer to disclose to avoid the inevitable struggle to get my needs met. Had i been diagnosed in school, i might have had a different life, and I want my son to have that opportunity. I want him to have the choice to go to university if he wishes.

TLDR Is there some happy medium between making the college aware of my son's needs, and my son's need to keep his autism private? It's fairly obvious to anyone (with any knowledge of autism) when you talk to him, that he is somewhere on the spectrum.

I'm grateful for all and any advice!"

One of the main bonuses with me is that I can visualise 3D objects in my mind and manipulate them, it¡¯s sounds like something most people can do but I have this kinda extra layer to it. 
If I have an idea for something I immediately know what it will look like, but if I have to explain it to someone it¡¯s very difficult without giving them a visual example, for example I had this project for my engineering course, and it was a musical instrument for a Nursery school, we had to make it from scratch, I came up with the model in my head knowing what it would look like and how it worked, however my friends didn¡¯t understand what I was saying until I modelled it on CAD.

autism,hasnoredditname,2020/1/27,"NT vs Autism - Us vs Them I recently started a social media presence (@NeuroTD on twitter) because I wanted to start talking about topics and be able to have a conversation with others, I feel I have a lot of advice and can help, so if you feel like it could benefit you, I am there!

&amp;#x200B;

I named myself NeuroTypicallyDiverse, because I grew up believing I was Neurotypical. I learned to one. One of the main things I see a lot of is ""Us vs Them"" ""Neurotypical vs Autism"" mentality that I feel can hold us back, now of course, this is just my opinion, and I welcome others, and the conversation around it.

However, I feel a lot of people may blame NT people for not understanding autism, and as I grew up and encountered people with autism, I never understood it either. Unfortunately, it is how the world works right now, or at least has been working, I feel there is a change coming. Now I am not here to defend bad NT people, who purposefully mistreat any person, with any disability. I am concerned though at certain things I see / read.

When I was diagnosed at 32 (I'm 33 now) I actually lost all my friends, and 90% of my family. They said the usual stuff like ""You don't look autistic"" and ""autism doesn't define you because you are still the same person"" and even others telling me I'm too sensitive and to get over it. I have spent a year volunteering with adults with autism and met so many people from so many walks of life. Each person has a unique version of autism, with their own traits, complications and issues to face every day.

&amp;#x200B;

With something so complex, I never get upset over an NT person from understanding, because it is almost impossible to understand, when you really drill it down to what autism is. Do I think we should be unfairly treated, no of course not. However if autism doesn't affect somebody or their life, there should be forgiveness that they don't automatically understand what it is or how to support someone fairly. I feel there should be forgiveness for an NT person not wanting to learn either. Ultimately, they have their life, their problems, and probably a lot of things to deal with that we don't see. Much like the things they can't see us dealing with on a day to day basis. Is there room for conversation? Yes, and if that were able to happen, then everybody can grow with knowledge and understanding. Like I said though, autism is so complex that it would be difficult for any one person to get their head around (unless they are affected by it)

&amp;#x200B;

Do I think we should give up? Not even in the slightest. I just feel the power of forgiveness is more empowering to the power of anger / hate. I feel understanding our own autism, and finding our place in this world, can help open doors to conversation more naturally. The world has been set in stone for so long, that NT people are ""in charge"" or so to speak, we need to infiltrate their ranks, and make change from within! Ok, that is a bit of an extreme situation, but I feel a lot of people can limit their own growth, based on the idea of being held back by the ignorant NT people they encounter. Which is completely understandable, but their ignorance (for the most part) isn't based in hate, a lot of NT people don't mean to upset people with autism, they don't want to attack us, limit us, control us. I feel if we push back against them, attack them for their ignorance, change will be more difficult than it needs to be.

&amp;#x200B;

I do believe the world is changing, and I am happy to fight for our rights and being equal, but growing up not caring about autism was such a natural state, that it took me a long time to understand autism myself, even though I spent an entire year immersed in the culture, and learning as much as I can. Now if it takes me and my analytical brain a whole year of constant, learning and knowledge, (I literally spent 12 hours a day doing anything I can around autism) How can we expect a basic NT person to understand us instantly?

&amp;#x200B;

There will one day be a world where there is no division, and we will just ""fit in"" with society, and I am sad that I probably won't ever see that day myself. However, I want to fight for that day, and future generations. I can't do that by blaming NT people for not understanding straight away.

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts? I will try to reply to as many people as I can

My partner's eight year old ASD son has started talking a lot more lately, which is outstanding and we are really encouraging of him using words to get what he wants. However with this has come a cycle of repetitive demands that he seems to get stuck in constantly until he is just sitting there asking for certain things non stop. 

We try to redirect his attention and distract him with things he enjoys but it doesn't seem to help. For example, recently we drove for five hours back from holiday and he asked non-stop for an iceblock, even though he had been given two at certain points along the way.

I plan to tell my doctor at my next visit (in early February) that I've been wondering if I might be on the autism spectrum, and see what next steps he might recommend.

I'm looking for information/research/articles about how autistic traits, specifically having special interests, affect occupational outcomes for those on the spectrum. 

I read an online article that said that people on the spectrum with special interests can be frustrated when they aren't able to focus on their interest (like at work, or school, where they have to focus on an assigned task instead). I've searched, but I can't find the article I read, or any other article that mentions this. 

I'm a 40 year old female with diagnoses of anxiety, depression, ADHD, etc. and an abysmal work history.  I've been receiving disability payments since 2009.

Before reading about special interests, I've never been able to really put my finger on and express the anxious feeling (in addition to social anxiety) I get when I'm at work.

It's more than boredom, it's more than difficulty concentrating - I'm agitated that I can't engage with my interest/obsession.

I spend so much time on the internet seeking information about it, that I've told my therapist I have an internet addiction. But, I don't think I'm addicted to the internet so much as I am addicted to researching my obsession(s). 

If anyone happens to have information to share with me about special interests specific to adults on the spectrum and/or interference with job performance, I would be very grateful!

I'm female, and I identify as a highly sensitive person (HSP) but without the empathy component. I have OCD, GAD, and sometimes get panic attacks. I had crippling social anxiety as a child and have only somewhat overcome it through repeated exposure and experience. When I go into a new social situation I like to have a ""safe person"" with me (like my husband) who can pick up my social slack and mitigate my anxiety just by being present.

I could go into a lot more detail (and will in comments if you ask) about my traits that cause me to suspect autism (like obsessive interests and certain physical sensitivities?), but what makes me doubt it is that I seem to understand social ""rules"" fairly well. (I could be fooling myself though.) Or maybe I just memorized the rules over time? (But how else would you do it?)

Mostly, I'm looking for opinions, information about other's experiences with autism, and if anyone here with autism can or can't relate to what I'm saying. Hopefully that makes sense. I look forward to your comments and questions."
autism,velvert,2020/1/14,"Excitement for college turned into demotivation College started back up again today, I was very excited but it seems my verdict for this semester is already sealed. Im gonna lose my scholarship automatically because one of my classes that was 2 credits got changed to 1 so now I dont have enough credits to keep my scholarship no matter how well I do. Along with that, my voice classes dont start for another two weeks and ny piano instructor has not even contacted me yet and I know nothing about it. Does this sound fixable? I seriously think its too late to change classes, idk why they changed the credit amount for the class."
autism,lydess,2020/2/24,"Crash course in kids Sorry if this is the wrong sub to post this in, delete if this is the case.

I¡¯m going for an IT job at a school for children with special needs and as you can imagine a majority of the cohort have various conditions that place them on the spectrum.

Part of the process involves a day shadowing a teacher on duty to interact with the kids, can anyone give me or point me towards a crash course guide in how not to screw up and accidentally spook or make a child with special needs feel scared, anxious or otherwise unhappy?, stuffing an interview is bad but god knows I don¡¯t want to ruin a kids day because I spoke in the wrong tone or with the wrong stance or something to that effect.

Any help you could provide would be greatly appreciated.

autism,quantizeduniverse,2020/3/7,"Am I autistic? Adult diagnosis in the UK? I'm old enough that when I was a child, anyone getting a diagnosis of autism was rare and it was also somewhat unwanted (by parents) due to a high degree of stigma surrounding the subject.

In my adult life I've been told by many people that they believe I'm autistic or Asperger's. 

I really don't know what to think - but it's happening more often now - and three of the most recent, tentative 'diagnoses' came from people who work in that area (one of them a twenty year veteran in the field, working with adults on the spectrum)

I have no idea how to feel about that. I do know I feel a profound sense of alienation, depression and anxiety. I haven't had a job for most of my adult life and nor have I managed to maintain a functional relationship with a 'significant other.'

I do however have a small number of very close friends, only some of whom believe me to be autistic.

At times I believe I can excel in social situations, usually when I'm feeling strong, energised and confident (the rest of the time I hide)

That said,  my last girlfriend (I usually attempt such a thing once every 5 years or so) was freaked out that I never (or rarely) looked her in the eyes; I thought that was normal - a sort of 'politics of vision' if you will - presumably some kind of throwback to our primate days?

I don't think there's anything idiosyncratic in my speech but a close friend back at University told me (unprompted) that she thought there is - and said I seemed like I had Asperger's.

Are people just confusing verbosity, a few eccentricities or even my profound depression with autism? Do people even know what autism is - or is it just a term thrown at people who struggle to fit in?

I'm a little perturbed by the increasing frequency with which people raise the subject - but perhaps that's merely a consequence of being a shut-in for most of my life - and only now coming into contact with more people; and perhaps that's compounded by the increased awareness and casusl interest people seem to have in the subject in general.

I don't want to be autistic - but that said, if it's a meaningful term and I am autistic, it's at least possible that a diagnosis would help improve a life that, so far I have found to be mostly confounding. 

I live in the UK - how would I even get a diagnosis? I'm an adult stepping into middle age, not a child; and either way, I feel like I'm on the scrap heap of life, so seeking a diagnosis this late could very well be pointless.

I really just don't know anything anymore."

There are roughly 80-100 billion neurons in the brain, but a far greater number of glial cells are needed to ensure the brain functions appropriately. In this episode, Neuroscience PhD Candidates &amp; manuscript authors Matthew Maksoud and Viki Tellios join us to discuss the mechanisms that regulate microglia phagocytosis - AKA eating dead cells - and how the brain maintains healthy function in aging and after injury. Because neurons get all the attention, you don't hear too much about glia. Although glia cells DO NOT carry nerve impulses (action potentials) they do have many important functions. In fact, without glia, the neurons would not work properly!
Manuscript: Nitric oxide upregulates microglia phagocytosis and increases transient receptor potential vanilloid type 2 channel expression on the plasma membrane - published in the journal Glia: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/glia.23685

Abstract

Microglia phagocytosis is critical for central nervous system development, and dysregulation of phagocytosis may contribute to a variety of neurological disorders. During initial stages of phagocytosis, microglia display increased nitric oxide (NO) production via inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity and amplified calcium entry through transient receptor potential vanilloid type 2 (TRPV2) channels. The present study investigated the regulatory role of iNOS/NO signaling in microglial phagocytosis and TRPV2 channel activation using phagocytosis assay, calcium imaging, patch clamp electrophysiology, immunocytochemistry, and immunoblot assays. Results showed that primary microglia from iNOS©\knockout (iNOS?/?) mice exhibited substantial deficits in phagocytic capacity and TRPV2 channel activity relative to wild©\type (WT) controls. Specifically, iNOS?/? microglia displayed a lower level of TRPV2 protein localized on the plasma membrane (PM) without any significant change in the mRNA levels of Fc©\gamma receptors and TRPV2. In addition, iNOS?/? microglia, unlike their WT controls, failed to elicit a calcium influx in response to application of the TRPV2©\agonist 2©\aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2APB). Importantly, the phagocytic capacity and the PM expression and activity of TRPV2 in iNOS?/? microglia were largely corrected by pretreatment with NO©\donors. Accordingly, the 2APB©\evoked calcium influx and the PM expression of TRPV2 in WT microglia were significantly decreased by selective inhibition of iNOS, protein kinase©\G (PKG), or phosphoinositide©\3©\kinase (PI3K), respectively. Together, results from this study indicated that iNOS/NO signaling upregulates microglial phagocytosis and increases TRPV2 trafficking to the PM via PKG/PI3K dependent pathway(s)."

Quick sidebar, that while not as as extreme and debilitating as gender disparity can be, I have come to learn and empathize with their struggles because of my own lack of knowledge for how my own body and mental processes work.

Not sure who else experiences this, but the majority of my childhood memories are either non-existent or only negative: vomiting in my bed in the middle of the night multiple times a week growing up, vomiting and other processes occurring late in age and even in public situations, unable to realize I had a fever, becoming addicted to drinking in ""social"" situations and never knowing how to control it.

For the most part these have all been reduced to no occurrence. In the last year (the drinking was the last to go). But it's kind of crazy to now look back and feel unaccomplished on a daily basis because I no longer have to overcome these hurdles I placed for myself.

Discuss delayed post-exposure toxicity and stories. The damage to your mental and physical health can occur after you stop the drug. So many young men and women have had their mental health damaged, sometimes permanently, by taking accutane (or isotretinoin), even at a normal dose.

Although there's been a long-standing ""controversy"" about whether accutane actually causes mental health issues, there is irrefutable scientific proof that it does indeed change (sometimes permanently) key functions of the brain in multiple ways.

Keep in mind: the ""proof"" that accutane does NOT cause depression (which is, unfortunately, the current conviction of most dermatologists) is industry-funded, poorly conducted research.

If you developed mental health issues (depression, anxiety, suicidality, psychosis, brain fog/cognitive issues, memory issues, OCD, bipolar, schizophrenia, anhedonia, etc), after taking accutane, there is very good reason to believe that accutane directly damaged your brain.

I'm 20, where I live we can start classes to get a driver's license when we're 18, I got mine 2 months before I reached the age of 19, and got my car the same day I got my license (the car was purchased weeks ahead, we were waiting for it to arrive)

I drove my car very little, so much so that the battery constantly die due to lack of use, forcing us to call insurance to get it recharged every 10 days or so

I don't feel the urge to go out, it's not that I don't like to go out, but if I'm in a situation where I'm going out by myself and have no obligation to go, I'd rather stay at home, if someone is inviting me, then I get the urge to go out, but I'm not the one who ask people out to hang out somewhere, no matter if it's friends or family.

I stated very clearly before my parents settled that I would need a car, that ""they'd have more use out of it than I would"" and...I was right, my father sold his car shortly before my car arrived and he stated to use it daily to work, coincidentally it was the prime time for me to use the car, but I didn't want to ask him to not go to work and let me use the car to have fun, even though he said it was ok for me to do so, simply because I think one thing is more important than the other.

So now I'm 20, I wrecked my car by my house's gate, and got really bad because of it, my parents tried to calm me down saying ""it's normal"" and ""it happens to everyone"", since that day, I didn't drive my car once, I don't like to drive arround, I don't like the idea that any mistake I make on the road could cost either a lot of money to fix or my life, and I got really anxious driving downtown to go to college, this car is more of a headache than it is useful to me atm, I don't feel like driving, I don't want it anymore.

anxiety,glitterismyantidrug_,2020/4/17,"I really want therapy but I've been avoiding it for years because I reflexively cry in front of doctors. I've been struggling with some sort of depression/anxiety cocktail for a long time and have been telling myself for years that I need professional help, but the anxiety of knowing I'm going to burst into tears for no good reason has been keeping me away. I know it's going to happen because of some past attempts at therapy, and I also tend to get choked up in front of doctors, professors, managers, pretty much any situation that requires being vulnerable and advocating for myself.

I'm not really scared of therapists judging me, it's just that every time I'm trying to explain why I'm there or answer a question and start crying, they seem to immediately take it as some sign of extreme, repressed trauma and don't understand that truly they could have just asked about the weather and I would've had the same reaction. Even if I try to explain that, from experience it feels like they think I'm in denial and then spend the whole visit probing at whatever little thing happened to push me over the edge, and then I cry more from anxiety and embarrassment and end up leaving the office feeling exhausted and hopeless because now my therapist thinks I have PTSD related to talking about my job or something instead of what I actually went in for.

I just really wish I could stop myself from doing it or have a way to explain myself in advance or something. It feels like a huge catch-22 because I know I need therapy to fix the problem but the problem is mentally keeping me from going to therapy ??"

anxiety,quantumcipher,2020/3/23,"Study finds daily meditation decreases anxiety and improves cognitive functioning in new meditators Thought some of you might find this helpful. As with anything, take it with a grain of salt, be aware your results may vary, and foremost consult a medical professional when in doubt or if experiencing severe symptoms. Stay safe, and chill everyone.

&gt; Only 8 weeks of daily meditation can decrease negative mood and anxiety and improve attention, working memory, and recognition memory in non-experienced meditators. These findings come from a recent study published in Behavioural Brain Research.
&gt; 
&gt; Meditation is a mental exercise that uses mindfulness techniques to work on attention and awareness with the goal of achieving a calmer state of mind. The practice of meditation is said to foster greater self-awareness, enhance emotional regulation, improve focus, and alleviate stress. But little is known about whether short, practical meditation sessions provide cognitive benefits for inexperienced meditators.
&gt; 
&gt; The study included a total of 42 non-experienced meditators between the ages of 18 and 45 who were split into two randomized groups. One group practiced 13 minutes of daily guided meditation over an 8-week period. The second group (the control group) listened to 13 minutes of a podcast every day for 8 weeks. Researchers compared the results between the two groups to see how meditation might improve cognition when compared to podcast listening.
&gt; 
&gt; Throughout the study, researchers had participants complete neuropsychological tasks to test their cognitive functioning and answer self-reported questionnaires to assess their mood state. To assess participants¡¯ stress levels at the physiological level, saliva cortisol samples were also taken. All data was collected at the start of the study, again at the 4-week period, and finally at the 8-week period when the study ended.
&gt; 
&gt; At the end of the study, participants completed the Trier Social Stress Test, a test designed to elicit social stress. Researchers administered the state anxiety portion of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory right before the social stress test, immediately after the test, and 10, 20 and 30 minutes after the test to measure participants¡¯ acute response to stress.
&gt; 
&gt; Results showed no significant difference in cognitive function, mood, or cortisol levels between the meditation and podcast groups at the 4-week point. However, results at the 8-week mark were a different story. When compared to the podcast listening group, participants in the meditation group showed decreased mood disturbance, anxiety, and fatigue scores. They also showed improved attention, working memory and recognition memory and a decrease in the behavioral anxiety response to the Trier Social Stress Test.
&gt; 
&gt; Although cognitive benefits related to meditation practice have been demonstrated before, this study was the first to show them for novice meditators. Mindfulness research is relatively new and much needs to be explored with regards to specific mechanisms in the brain that are involved in meditation. The current study suggests that daily meditation has significant benefits to practitioners, even those who are new to meditation and only practicing in brief sessions.
&gt; 
&gt; The study, ¡°Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, and emotional regulation in non-experienced meditators¡±, was authored by Julia C. Basso, Alexandra McHale, Victoria Ende, Douglas J. Oberlin, and Wendy A. Suzuki.

Abstract:

&gt; Meditation is an ancient practice that cultivates a calm yet focused mind; however, little is known about how short, practical meditation practices affect cognitive functioning in meditation-na?ve populations. To address this question, we randomized subjects (ages of 18¨C45) who were non-experienced meditators into either a 13-min daily guided meditation session or a 13-min daily podcast listening session (control group) for a total duration of 8 weeks. We examined the effects of the daily meditation practice relative to podcast listening on mood, prefrontal and hippocampal functioning, baseline cortisol levels, and emotional regulation using the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Compared to our control group, we found that 8 but not 4 weeks of brief, daily meditation decreased negative mood state and enhanced attention, working memory, and recognition memory as well as decreased state anxiety scores on the TSST. Furthermore, we report that meditation-induced changes in emotional regulation are more strongly linked to improved affective state than improved cognition. This study not only suggests a lower limit for the duration of brief daily meditation needed to see significant benefits in non-experienced meditators, but suggests that even relatively short daily meditation practice can have similar behavioral effects as longer duration and higher-intensity mediation practices."

Also a special shout-out to Russel Brand and his YouTube channel who provides interesting insights into all this, while still being an absolute joker and natural poet. He's really helped me look at things differently and sort whats important in my thinking, to what is invaluable noise from the 'panicked population' 
https://www.youtube.com/user/russellbrand 

It's important more than ever to keep our minds busy and distracted from a constant bombardment of negative, fear-inducing news. My recommendation during this time is to stick to a 3-step programme to help keep our minds at ease.

I call this the 3 M's:
Mindfullness
Meditation
Masturbation

Fear is a healthy response to danger, but unfortunately a lot of us are struggling with the overwhelming nature of the Coronavirus pandemic.  


My approach is very simple, broken into 'how', 'why it works' and 'variations'. They are written with the beginner in mind and as such are simplistic in their instructions and explanation. They are all variations of mindfulness practice, working on the concept that thoughts (all mental phenomena really) can be observed from a detached perspective.  


This detachment will result in less emotional reactivity and an increased ability to maintain functionality during stressful times  


My hope is that it will help people to better cope during this time.  To this end I also encourage the use of ongoing self care and therapy.

anxiety,alexmacmusic,2020/1/16,"How do you get over anxiety about having anxiety attacks? I'm currently very limited with my life outside of my house because my anxiety is at point where I'm not anxious about any one thing, I'm only anxious about getting anxious. If I get anxious in a situation, like driving on a certain street, every time I think about getting back in the car and going on that certain street, my mind instantly goes straight to investing time in painting a picture made of anxiety. So then when I do go back on that street, I've already visualised having a panic attack 10 times before I've even left rhe house, and lonebehold, I have a panic attack, or at least have to intensely manage my anxiety to avoid one. This happens in the simplest situations.

So to me this is a vicious cycle

Get anxious in a certain situation for some reason &gt; then associate that situation with anxiety &gt; then begin visualising having panic attacks in that situation beforehand &gt; then have a panic attack in that situation due to association and visualisation which then strengthens the anxiety for the next time round

Any ideas on how to break the cycle?"

I have a weird , functional anxiety in the sense that I don't have stage fright as much, and have overcome my fear of talking to other people, though I do feel like I am being judged constantly. I overthink about the smallest things, and my mind never truly rests. my mind is always all around the place and thoughts race to my head waiting for the finishing line they don't find.

Recently, I got accepted to my dream college, and instead of being happy for even a day, my happiness lasted for a second. My thoughts jumped back to fears, getting decisions from other colleges, finances (even though I am fortunate enough that my parents can afford tuition fee, I just don't for some reason want to spend so much on myself because I just don't feel like I am worth it). 

I am super super secretive about my life because the moment I start something and tell someone about it, I think that if I stop, or don't become perfect at what I am doing, I'll be judged. I find it hard to be happy for a long duration, and it's the first time I am writing on reddit, mostly because I want to feel like I am not alone, there are others like me, and hopefully my anxiety becomes slight more better to live with."

anxiety,hodlthedoor8,2020/1/13,"Anxious muscle twitches, weird tingling, nervous tension, and uneasy sleep. Hey y'all, 

For the last 6+ months, I have been struggling with some form of anxiety and also depression. It came on due to my unwillingness to take on what I was responsible for at the right time in my teenage and early adult life (being schoolwork, university, studies and tasks around the home, etc.), the gradual disposition that I built with unhealthy habits like drinking and partying on weekends, which I think was in effort to mask my inability of genuinely connecting with people and be really interested in hobby or schoolwork and a career, leading to me having a nervous breakdown at the start of last year and having to be on medication for \~2-3 months. 

Since then I was successfully off the medication for around 4 months and have been having a strange tingling sensation in my scalp, which feels like it could be between the scalp and skull or skull and bran. It is at times accompanied by feelings of anxiety when I feel stuck with my thoughts and get stressed because I don't know how to solve a problem I get a wave of anxiety and tingling sensation under my.. testicles (&gt;.&lt;). It's a really strange sensation. - Has anyone experienced this before? Also, I sometimes have a muscle twitch in random parts of my body when I am maybe feeling slightly stressed or I have to think about something distressing, that triggers an emotional response. 

Lastly, I experience interrupted sleep and will wake up every 3 hours or so, and at times I wake up early in the morning and am not really able to get back to sleep for the rest of the morning, usually sleeping for 6 hours on average and feeling mentally tired for consecutive days. Some nights when I have sleep anxiety or frustration due to inability of sleep I will get angry and emotionally riled up and not be able to sleep. 

Currently I spend a lot of time at home by myself, reading forums and doing online courses, I am looking for a new job. My relationships with friends are not amazing as I feel that I am not able to be emotionally available most of the time since I am experiencing these thoughts/ feelings of anxiety and depression. 

Anyone out there that has experienced something similar in the past or present? Any suggestions welcomed. I am meditating at least 2x week, and making an effort to eat a clean diet. No medication at the moment, except using Kava as a natural sleep supplement some nights."

For a while it's gone away, but recently I've found that I only get these more intense episodes of anxiety when I've been drinking alcohol the night before. This has come to the point where I'm considering stopping drinking on the whole (even though I don't drink often anyway) because these episodes have become so bad that the day after isn't really worth the night before.

## [The Four Main Types of Anxiety](https://kensington.coach/hypnotherapy-anxiety-london/)

 Social Anxiety

Also known as society fear,[social anxiety](https://kensington.coach/hypnotherapy-anxiety-london/)?refers to an intense fear of being criticised, humiliated or embarrassed even in everyday situations and leads to lack of confidence in yourself. It is a fear of a range of social situations. It keeps you from rising above and make you feel overwhelmed regarding daily social activities. Social anxiety makes you think that people are judging you and will surely be giving negatives remarks regarding your personality and opinions.hypnotherapy anxiety London.

All such thoughts stamp negative effects on life. Victims start panicking and feel uneasy in gatherings. They stop meeting with people; their communication becomes severely affected and bounds them within themselves, which also affects the relationships.

### Work Anxiety

Excessive worry related to the work is?[work anxiety](https://kensington.coach/hypnotherapy-anxiety-london/). It may include stress due to having a demanding boss, doing long shifts, or having a high workload. Moreover, when you do not get proper directions for completing tasks, you get under stress. In addition to this, not getting enough payback of your contributions to work may also add to this stress.

All these factors contribute to a negative impact on your professional life. The stress leads to irrational worrying, trouble falling or staying asleep, and inflated startle reaction. You easily get offended by your co-employees and also become over-reactive. You lose concentration and focus and may destroy your relationship with other staff.

### Performance Anxiety

Also known as stage phobia,?[performance anxiety](https://kensington.coach/hypnotherapy-anxiety-london/)is a fear of inability to perform a specific task. In this situation, you lack self-confidence and find it extremely challenging to face the task and hand. It leads to excessive worry about failing a task before it has even started and a belief that the failure will result in rejection or humiliation.

Beside excessive sweating, heart palpitations, and elevated blood pressure during performing a task, it also leads to increased errors and impacts your overall performance. It makes you feel confused and unfit for the job at hand. It keeps you from effectively showing your skills and talents.

### Health Anxiety

Stress regarding health is one of the most dangerous forms of anxiety. You start feeling that you are suffering from serious health disorders such as organ failures. Also, you start assuming that you are a victim of many rather every severe disease despite assurance by medical specialists that you are a healthy individual.

The anxiety stuffs your head with unnecessary thoughts and lessens the quality of your life. It makes you worry all the time, and you become unable to function or enjoy life due to such fears and preoccupations.

anxiety,raspberryslug2,2020/1/13,"(Long Post) My Anxiety based out of fear of causing Racism / thoughts of racial slurs Recently I have had great anxiety in regards to randomly having racial thoughts wrapped up in my head, particularly racial slurs such as the n-word and its variations filling up whenever I have introspective thoughts. At first I did not know why it happened as I don't recall any particularly event that caused this beforehand. It got really bad and soon enough I had to consult a psychologist to analyse my problem. They explained to me how my racial-related anxiety was born out of an unknown threat caused by the unconscious, and suggested that I practice mindfulness and self-conversation to cope with my problem. The following day I had long hours of self thought and realized this particular anxiety is born out of my fear of causing harm towards other races and others to cause the same thing. As a POC myself (I am Asian), I have experienced numerous cases of prejudice and ignorance from others and of course, the following anxiety came about as I have witnessed through incidents many cases of anti-blackness and ignorance in general towards other races in South-East Asia (I currently live here). Even before this problem came about I have already educated myself greatly in terms of racism and anti-blackness and how to not inflict it to others, and to make myself realize that thoughts =/= actions. Yet one day I still want to purge these racial thoughts from my head and to live my life normally without an anxiety attack coming up here and there. I want to clarify that I never have any intrusive thoughts on phsyically violating POC, just the mere fact of thinking these racial slurs make me guilt-trip and cause anxiety.

anxiety,fullmetalheartbeat,2020/1/8,"Does anyone else who grew up with intense social anxiety catch themselves subconsciously acting almost childlike/helpless in certain settings and realize that they use that as a sort of coping mechanism? Crossposted w/ r/DoesAnybodyElse.

Let me preface this by saying that I am NOT talking about intentionally acting ""disabled"" or anything like that. It wasn't that I decided to do that, not at all.


It's more that sometimes when you have social anxiety you can get into this dynamic where people see you as incompetent and helpless, and you feel incompetent and helpless. And in some cases it can feel safer psychologically to lean into that helplessness and have people patronize you, rather than to try and prove competence and potentially prove ""just enough"" to get your patronize pass revoked, but not seem competent enough to prove yourself, in which case instead of patronizing you people might act towards you with hostility.


I was very, very school smart, but seemed ""incompetent"" and felt ""stupid"" in almost every other area of my life. So I kind of convinced myself that I was one of those ""socially akward smart people,"" which I suppose isn't entirely untrue, but I had a moment of self-awareness in college where I realized I was sort of wearing that like a shield, and leaning into my awkwardness MORE around people who ""just don't GET anxiety."" 

Eventually I realized it was kind of counterproductive and that it was keeping me from gaining confidence in certain settings, and perpetuating dynamics between myself and others that I wasn't happy with.

anxiety,OctalGorrila8,2020/3/28,"I lied to a team member about Covid-19 exposure because I wasn't informed I'm an assistant manager for a mid-sized team and this entire situation is really fueling my distrust in the people above me.? For the past three weeks, I've observed a growing disconnect between line level associates, supervisors, managers and upper management as the people above me struggle to convey information to the team.? It's gotten to the point where my direct report isn't even conveying department policy regarding Covid-19 anymore except for on a need-to-know basis and even instructing assistant managers and supervisors to convey information that should come from the top (such as the option to voluntary furlough, directives from risk management, etc.).


Unfortunately this lack of communication had now led to incorrect information being shared.


Thursday night right before going home, I received a call from a supervisor who asked if it's true that someone in our department tested positive for Covid-19 and people are being asked not to come in to work today.? I told them the most recent update is that we had a team member depart two weeks ago who will be out for the duration of the pandemic due to underlying health issues.? This is true.


Today my manager called me telling me not to come into work today, reassured me that I did not come in contact with anyone who had tested positive because those people had already been contacted, and that the building we work in will be closed for a week to be deep cleaned.


A few minutes after this call I texted a friend who works in an office nearby to ask for his thoughts on the lockdown, and he informed me that he tested positive.? I've been talking to him numerous times this week in close proximity and he was fine, but last week he was sick as a dog.??


Now my mind a racing since I have a compromised immune system.? Clearly not everyone was contacted who was in close proximity, and we're not being kept up on the most current information, which is especially irritating because as a manager I'm being kept out of the loop.? I gave false information to a direct report because of that.


While my company is making testing available to anyone who was exposed, I was not informed of my exposure to get in before the end of testing for the day, which my manager proceeded to throw back on me for not answering their call initially.? My manager didn't even know that I had close contact with someone who tested positive, so if I had answered the call initially I would not have any actionable information.? The only reason I have actionable information is because I happen to know him.


I've had chest pain all week, and I want to believe that it's just the stress getting to me.? I'm having such a hard time wrapping my head around all this and just spent an hour curled up in the shower."

anxiety,Serdterg,2020/4/20,"PSA: excess glutamate is often implicated in anxiety  

Tl;dr excess glutamate is a common  cause of anxiety and dissociation; NMDA agonists such as magnesium  glycinate and sarcosine may greatly aid in treating these

^(everything below is to my understanding, might be some incorrect dumb shit in here)

The NMDA receptor among other uses, is a glutamate receptor. NMDA  receptors  are extremely important for memory and modulating synaptic  plasticity,  however glutamate is a potent excitotoxin, which ends up killing brain cells along with very often causing and/or provoking anxiety and  dissociative disorders

NMDA   agonists such as magnesium glycinate compete for ion binding sites  with  glutamate and this is important to prevent excess glutamate from  building, magnesium glycinate and sarcosine are often credited along  with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) for alleviating OCD tendencies/rumination,   anxiety and dissociative symptoms. For reasons I can't recall right now  this also applies to Anafranil, a tricyclic antidepressant.

Anticonvulsants  such as Lamictal and Gabapentin due to sodium channel blocking  properties  suppress release of glutamate, similarly and also serve as a  mood stabilizer, also contributing to the effects of the NMDA  agonists.

Lastly Americans are  very often deficient in magnesium; oxide forms also absorb poorly and  citrate is a laxative. Magnesium deficiencies coincide with the symptoms  of excess glutamate"

Hey guys, first time posting here, recently I was diagnosed with a massive anxiety disorder(about 4-5 months ago) A little backstory, I was and still am very anti-drug in terms of illegal (or legal) for that matter consumption, however this anxiety disorder started after I overdosed on Preworkout after I was on it for roughly 4-5 months straight, it was a very high dose stimulant coupled with my usual 8-9 cups of coffee a day, while the physical anxiety has died down, the mental anxiety has stayed with me until recently(kinda).

After a few months of different medications, Quetiapine, Mirtazipine and Lexapro(Was on lexpro for around 6 years before this) it wasn't until my psych prescribed me dexamphetamine for what I thought didn't exist or that I grew out of, severe ADHD, that I actually started being able to have a clear mind and reason with myself again.

Again a quick little bit of backstory, before this happened to me I was like a rug on valium, the most chilled guy you'll ever meet who just went to the gym and played video games I had absolutely 0 problems in the world and never had anxiety about literally anything, so to have a mental condition sprung on me out of nowhere was always a little strange since I believed it was a medical problem(started with a panic attack from the overdose, then a second one a few days later, then just happened nonstop for weeks) so now I get to the question.

Why would Dexamphetamine make me feel normal and grounded as opposed to say valium or other traditional anxiety medications, surely a stimulant is the last thing that would help an anxiety disorder, and this is the crux of the problem here, I don't know exactly why and how it's making me feel better is it possible that my overindulgence of caffeine and nicotine ( alot of nicotine since i was around 17 am now 30) and intense workout have essentially done to my brain what happens to drug addicts when they ""fry"" themselves out?

I'm just having a hard time understanding this and would like to see some research or hear opinions on this condition that got thrust on me, is the problem dopamine-related as opposed to serotonin-related? I know Reddit isn't a qualified doctor but it would be good to get some things I could take to my therapists to look at with them and hopefully pin down why I have this chronic overthink and anxiety after 30+ years of complete chill(except childhood).

Thanks guys."
anxiety,Exciting_Swan,2020/1/30,"Wrongly interpreting anxiety as depression? tl;dr did anyone else think they were depressed, but actually not depressed and instead had anxiety/anxiety disorder.

Hello everyone,

I hope im not breaking any rules, just looking for some clarification.

Im not sure I really have a disorderly form of anxiety, but Ive come to some conclusions about my mental health that Id like to express.

Ive recently been going through a bit of a low mood, nothing too major, and probably just a result of finishing college, stress, normal things.

However, Ive also come to have a lot of mood swings throughout the day, going from feeling fine and mostly normal to crashing and feeling like everything is about to crash down around me. I think I had begun to interpret this as depression which absolutely terrified me and I spent way way too much time worrying about how I was going to have to live with that for my whole life.

However, when I think about it and spoke to a counselor, I had essentially zero diagnostic criteria for depression, aside from intermittent low mood/empty feelings but not sad, which felt more attribitule to poor sleep/diet/excercise/alcohol use which I then continued to stress and worry about way too much. 

Most days for the last few months Ive been feeling this, Id wake up with ease, go the gym where id calm down a bit, go to class, make lunch/dinner, study, go home and browse reddit/talk to friends before bed. I never struggled to do any of these or lost any motivation to do them, I just spent the whole time worrying about it for no apparent reason.

Before realizing this, everytime my mood dropped slightly or I felt a moderately stressful/negative emotion I would interpret this as the end of the world and that I had severe major depression and that my life was going to be miserable. Anytime I felt a good emotion or began to enjoy the things I worried I no longer enjoyed, I would overthink how I was feeling and it would take the enjoyment out of it.

Ive always tried to desrcibe it as a ""lingering background feeling of something being wrong and miserable"". 

I never considered this before because Im fairly naturally mindful about social situations to the point that any normal anxiety I feel say, going for a job interview, is just a physical sensation rather than actual worrying. It just makes a lot more sense since I feel like I spend a lot more time worrying about my emotions rather than actually feeling any depressive thoughts."
anxiety,SonOfYossarian,2020/1/10,"How to get rid of feeling that everyone is out to get me (after some people actually DID try to get me)? Hey y'all,

I've struggled with anxiety for a long time; a recurring fear of mine has been convincing myself that the whole world is out to get me. I know that's an irrational fear, and I've been trying to treat it as such, but something that happened recently is making that difficult.

Recently, a fellow student at my college attempted to have me removed from my officer position in one of my organizations. They attempted to do this by making up a fake story about something I had supposedly done and presenting it to our organization's executive board. While I was able to keep my position (mostly because a friend's snapchat story placed me far away from where the supposed ""incident"" occurred), the whole situation brought my issues back with a vengeance- I find myself seeing enemies everywhere, and constantly worry that someone else will try something similar in the future whenever they have a problem with me.

anxiety,throwawayfd9sid9sj,2020/2/2,"Anyone here with experience or expertise w/r/t bad health anxiety and food allergies?  I have an allergy appointment set for a few weeks from now but in the meantime the past few days have been absolutely grueling. I've been examining the ingredients of foods served to me and finding potential allergens I never would have even considered before. Each and every night has seen me practically paralyzed in fear of having some severe reaction before I am able to see this allergist, and worse, I've been experiencing some ambiguous symptoms I can't confirm aren't allergies vs mere anxiety.

I've been experiencing alternating tightness in my throat and chest, but particularly as of recently, my throat an hour or two after eating, and sometimes recurring hours after that. I initially chalked it up to anxiety, but last night it got bad enough to where I actually started to struggle to swallow my own saliva. This same night, for a period of time, my face was hotter than its ever felt before during any of these anxiety fits, enough to make me wonder if this time was for real. What's particularly scary is that this throat tightness alleviated soon after I took 25mg Benadryl as an experiment. It could easily be a placebo effect but I am more concerned than ever that there is some underlying allergy issue that could be worsening with the damage the last month's anxiety-caused stress has put on my body. FWIW, during last night's dinner I had beans which I later found to contain white mustard. I have had these beans countless times before as well as mustard sauce in general without issue, but in the past I experienced sore gums and a clogged throat following ingestion of sesame seed, which has common allergenic proteins IIRC. It makes me wonder if sensitization is occurring in the present moment as my body is in this state.

Is anyone here able to talk with me in PMs or perhaps off the site about how I can distinguish health anxiety from real allergies, or at least give an educated opinions on my potential health circumstances? I am seriously worried about how I will be able to hold up over these next few weeks."

I'm a 29 year old female in the US, living a pretty safe, comfortable and trauma-free life. But for as long as I can remember I have a lot of difficulty reading the news or wikipedia or anywhere where I might come across a story or narrative about people in trauma elsewhere in the world. I mean, it can be debilitating for me to the point where I can scroll past a headline in the morning and then spend 3 hours completely consumed by anxiety and panic and like, an almost compulsive inability to not imagine the situation and all of it's details. I realize being horrified the news is a common concern, but like, I feel like I'm functionally affected to a degree where it starts being a panic disorder or something. 

Here are some examples:

A few months ago I was visiting California with my 1 year old daughter and she started crying when we went to the beach and put our feet in the ocean. I suddenly got triggered to remember all of the stories I've read about refugees trying to cross the Mediterranean on tiny boats and became completely transfixed and couldn't speak or move for like 20 minutes because I was completely overwhelmed. It was like, I was imagining every single detail about a refugee mom on a boat with her toddler, and exactly how they'd feel when the water started coming into the boat, and how it would feel to fall into the water and realize you were about to drown, and how it would feel to see your child flailing in the water, the pain you'd feel in your lungs, and the utter sense of panic, and the devastation of seeing your baby drowning, and what the baby would feel... I mean, I just couldn't STOP. And every time I tried to stop the thought spiral, it just kept going on until my brain decided it was done. It was like, entirely out of my control.

anxiety,super_taz,2020/3/21,"COVID19 anxiety and worry about family Hello everyone, this is my first time posting here so bear with me please and thank you in advance for your helpful insight :)

Currently we are all facing an unprecedented pandemic event, my thoughts are out for every life loving fighter, I'm confident we will beat this sooner rather than later. 

I'm a university student living outside of my uni alone in a private room and rarely go out and about only for classes and shopping, recently they have enforced a lockdown where I live and decided to go back( 2 days before the lockdown while the number of the cases were low) to my parents place throughout this lockdown to be with them and  take care of them if they needed groceries and so on. I've booked the bus (4 hour journey) which was half empty in the morning and I arrived and kept my distance, I've been here for 4 days now practicing social distancing and cleaning my hands regularly though I'm truly getting anxious for my parents as I'm afraid that I have the virus and asymptomatic, transmitting it to them in the process, I might seem crazy but every time someone is coughing and feeling tired I instantly go blank, I start to internally freak out and assuming the worst possible. I'm really getting extremely worried and its taking a toll on me mentally and physically, I honestly can't seem to get over it, I start regretting my decision to come back and should have stayed back, but kind of thought it was okay as alot of students were leaving too, chose the time where the bus was empty and avoided any close contacts in the process.

Reading the news as well doesn't help at all. I hope someone else can help me figure out how to stop over thinking and train my mind to think positive, even if the situation turns out to be negative.

I'm truly tired, mentally and physically because of this habit of thinking."

anxiety,informant720,2020/4/3,"Do actors emulate anxiety or actually experience it for their roles? Whenever I see actors (Martin Freeman and Cate Blanchett come to mind) doing anxious roles/scenes, I can't help but notice how, even though they do a really good job at seeming anxious, they also seem maintain impeccable bodily/facial coordination. I mean, they have to, or else the scene wouldn't work, right? 

I'm not an expert on acting but I know that actors usually get themselves to start crying or getting emotional not by pretending, but by actually thinking of something emotionally distressing to elicit a real, physiological response. But with real anxiety, generally you get tunnel vision and lose fine coordination skills &amp; overall ""control"" of your actions. You can see how this could make a meticulously crafted dramatic scene fall apart pretty quickly.

 Still, somehow on top of creating the impression they're under a great deal of stress, good actors are able to time and deliver their lines+facial expressions so naturally and coordinate themselves reactively to whatever's going on in the scene - things that require tremendous control over your actions to pull off. This leads me to the question of: Are they really getting themselves to feel anxious and somehow overcoming the side effects, or are they actually calm, cool and collected before and after the cameras are rolling?"

anxiety,DinosaurRetard,2020/4/6,"A question regarding medication and existential anxiety I mean no disrespect to anyone who uses meds and finds that the meds they take work for them, but I find that medication, at least in my past, hasn't worked for me. I feel that part of the reason why I haven't found any success with medication is the fact that I know that my anxiety and depression are a result of prior emotional neglect and other negative experiences I've had during my childhood and adolescence. Luckily, I've found a great therapist, and I've found that therapy and learning to be vulnerable has helped me much more in 6 months than medication has in my younger years. 

However, I also believe that living in a place such as the US, where many people (including myself), are one accident or diagnosis away from financial ruin, is also a factor. There are many more other external factors which I believe lead to anxiety and depression in our times, and I think most of them are kinda obvious to most  people reading this. Factors such as: high rent prices, wages not keeping up with inflation, higher priced college education and the increasing reliance on it for meaningful work, the increasing lack of manufacturing jobs due to automation and offshoring/outsourcing, the increasing lack of community structure, climate change, and so on. The ways in which our economy and society are currently structured, I feel, contribute more to anxiety/depression than many people realize. 

With that said, it's obviously naive to believe that living in a utopian sort of society would alleviate every mentally ill individual's symptoms. Still, I feel that most of my anxiety/depression comes from this sort of existential dread. **Which leads to my question, if I feel that societal and environmental factors are the current cause of much of my anxiety/depression, what benefit will medication have on me?** I understand that there may be a reduction of symptoms with this, but while taking medication, I can't shake the feeling that my problems aren't actually being solved by taking them. I find that I am highly susceptible to the side effects from medication, which usually leads to my discontinuance of them. I also find that the 4-6 weeks that it takes for many psychiatric meds to reach full effectiveness, compounded with the fact that people can take dozens of meds to find the right regimen that works for them (I believe I took 4 or 5 different meds in the span of a year or two when I was younger), leads to a long period of experimentation that I feel hinders my quality of life rather than benefiting it. 

I've found organizational ways to deal with my ADHD, but I really tend to struggle with the mild existential anxiety and depression I experience, especially now during these trying times. If anyone has any book recommendations for existential ways at looking at mental health, or ways they help curb existential dread, I would greatly appreciate it."

I already know that some things that trigger my anxiety don't make sense at all for other people and I understand if they can't relate, but I don't understand why they can't be supportive and don't make me feel like an idiot for feeling anxious about something that's ""not such a big deal"" in reality.

I don't want to keep sharing with these people but most of my close friends are like this.

anxiety,crappyscifiwriter,2020/3/29,"I'm a little worried and now I need to vent, I suppose - an interesting story about my anxiety if nothing else 24 year old guy here, if thats relevant. So just over two years ago (about Dec 2017-Jan 2018) I had to leave uni during my final year, due to having absolutely horrid panic attacks for the first time in my life, particularly in situations where I had to sit and not really do much for an extended period of time (i.e. lectures). I took leave, and got prescribed Propranolol and Baclofen (an unusual one for anxiety from what I can tell, but man did it eliminate the horrible neck tightness I got almost immediately after I started taking it). In May 2018 though I got my very first job, as a dispenser in a pharmacy (I live in Scotland). This has been the most fantastic thing for me: my confidence has went up massively (particularly with women - even in uni I was a really shy thing but now like 80% of my friends are women haha), and I've found that I'm massively interested in medicines and medical technology and treatments (I did chemistry at uni so there was a bit of foundation there for me to geek out about this stuff).

Anyway, considering I just mentioned all that, its easy enough to guess whats coming next. It seems the world has gone to hell in a hand basket the past few weeks, and considering my job I'm literally reminded of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 on a daily, if not hourly basis. My mood on this subject is so mixed its crazy.

On the one hand, I'm not doing myself any favours. I've been reading a lot and watching a lot surrounding the subject of the novel coronavirus, and came to the conclusion it is super-difficult to wade through the massive amounts of info about it, and that in itself makes it scary. Theres somewhat reassuring (not necessarily cheery, but hopeful) sources of information, such as Dr John Campbell's Youtube channel (maybe its just his voice is calming), then there is Reddit's own /r/coronavirus - where every second post is about a young person dying from the disease, and almost making me feel like as a healthy young person I might be MORE at risk of getting severely ill from this thing.

On the other hand, I have a strange sense of purpose out of all of this, which is something I've never really had in my life before, and its resulted in a strange sense of resolve. I might not be as involved in this ""fight"" as a doctor or nurse directly treating coronavirus patients, but as a pharmacy employee I am in the UK considered a ""key worker"" meaning that even in our current lockdown (realistically more like semi-lockdown) state I'm still working and considered to be helping provide ""front-line health and social care"" to customers, often unwell ones, face-to-face.

So one part of me hates the way I'm placed. I didn't sign up for fighting a global pandemic, and I'm scared shitless at the inevitability that I'll catch this thing eventually - a 25 year old pharmacy tech in the US died recently from it. It frustrates me to no end seeing all of the ""stay home"" and ""#quarantine"" messages and posts, when I literally can't do those things myself - I'd love nothing more than to just sit in and play CoD Warzone for the next couple of months but I can't - I'd only be allowed to stay home if I actually caught the virus haha. But the other part of me in a strange way feels a sense of duty, and a sense of purpose, and the fact I am living through a moment that will go down in history and how I am a tiny part of that - I'm beginning to think being considered ""front-line"" has a nice ring to it, bad as that sounds. I don't know if I want to be that self-aggrandising to be called ""front-line"" but several people have now referred to me as being such.

I suppose you could say I'm very confused right now. I'm not looking for any solutions - leaving my job isn't an option for me - back to the whole ""sense of duty"" thing. But does anyone have any advice to help me out and feel better about my situation? Its a different type of anxiety from my panic attack situation, but its definitely scary nonetheless.

TLDR: anxiety sufferer, got a job in a pharmacy, now dealing with a global pandemic, mixed feelings about this"

Usually I am feeling pretty calm, then I might notice my thoughts feel a bit 'racey', and within a few minutes I will get a sudden wave of nausea in my gut or a hit of adrenaline. For the next 2 to 3 hours, I will get waves of increasingly intense nausea and adrenaline every few minutes, accompanied by a rapid heart rate (up to around 160bpm), high blood pressure, severe trembling, sweating, severe nausea, and the symptom that confuses me the most, diarrhea.

A couple of days ago I had another one of these attacks, and I decided to just lay down the entire time and see what happens. I managed to avoid feeling any adrenaline, but regardless the symptoms all persisted, and I had terrible diarrhea and nausea lasting the duration of the episode. It felt like even though I was keeping my head pretty calm this time, the heart rate and everything else was relentless anyway. Even if I stay calm, nothing changes.

I just don't know what to do anymore. It still seems like anxiety is the only explanation that makes sense, because what kind of stomach bug/any other condition would cause severe symptoms for just a few hours before completely stopping, and so intermittently at that?

Hey everyone, looking for a little help on settling my constant worry regarding freelance work¡ªeven though it shouldn¡¯t be an issue with the information I¡¯m about to submit. But over the last year, the constant cloud of anxiety has eroded any form of peace-at-mind. My sleeping has faltered, as has my athletic training, and I¡¯ve also started to drink a lot more which was prompted a number of callouts from my friends. Nothing drastic or heavy, just a few beers each night, but practically all seven days of the week. 

I¡¯ve been working as a freelancer for a number of years, and I found the perfect role working for an incredibly successful company. Over the past several years, my rate has continued to increase, the amount of work I¡¯ve been given continues to grow to the point where I sometimes have to decline a job because I'm already stretched thin, and the people who work there, now my friends, continually tell me that I never have to worry about this line of work stopping. For all accounts, it's indefinite. 

Now, I should happily be strolling through life thinking that I¡¯ve been gifted a great opportunity. Instead, I¡¯ve spent the better part of the last two years constantly worried, tearful, and somedays breathless, at thinking about what I would do if this job vanished. 

Of course, it¡¯s a possibility it could vanish, but in all counts with the years of evidence, it¡¯s highly unlikely.  

With that, does anybody have any suggestions on how I can start metaphorically breath again?"

I've suffered with depression and anxiety for a long time now, but have recently reached a point where I can recognise a thought to be catastrophising and an anxious one and able to dismiss it.

However, two times in the past month, these have actually happened unexpectedly. In one case, an otherwise seemingly healthy dog had to be put down at a routine vet check up, and another, a birth in the close family was stillborn today days before their due date.

How on earth am I meant to deal with my anxious, catastrophising intrusive thoughts, that I know are highly unlikely to ever happen, when twice recently major worries I'd ""recognised and sent away"" then...

anxiety,ElaineW93,2020/2/10,"My anxiety got worse in these last months and I can't afford mental health care. Any advice? I always had some unhealthy anxious attitude, but they never were cause for worry for me up until a couple of months ago. It would be normal for me to get extremely panicky about unrealistic scenarios, but it would go away after a while (For example once I dropped a tiny bit of olive oil on my laptop and spent two days figuring out any ways to dry it and make sure it was not inside, but after it was clear that it wasn't enough to cause any problems I calmed down, or another time I was convinced I had tetanus but when the doctor dismissed the idea I also calmed down, all one-off episodes)

In August I discovered I needed some dental work done, which was pretty scary because I already had a bunch of dental work done in the past and my teeth aren't in the best shape, and since that happened anxiety has skyrocketed and become omnipresent in my life. It started with me worrying about the future of my teeth, but even when that was solved, it looks like my brain keeps finding any irrational scenario to grip to and irrationally worry about. Sometimes it's medical stuff (i spent the whole October between doctors cause I was convinced my cold was aspiration pneumonia), but it's not just limited to that. All the scenario that my brain grips to are, to be fair, not impossible, I am not afraid that my shadow will come alive and murder me, but they are all unlikely to the extreme. Sometimes I even notice that my feeling of anxiety is still there, even if I can't find anything to be anxious about, and it just persists there.

I am starting to worry because this is not going away, and currently don't have any way to avail myself of any mental health services. It has not yet gotten to the point that my life is completely impeded by this stuff, but it takes a significant space in my brains and when it hits hard I can spend days worrying about something that I really shouldn't worry about.

Are there any good resources on how to deal with this stuff when I can't access proper care?"

anxiety,ArcadiusOfArcadia,2020/1/9,"I think I realized something about the source of my daily anxiety... I didn't sleep well last night (it wasn't one of those nights where I'm painfully aware of each passing minute, but rather one where I seemingly slept but I don't feel like I spent much time in deep, restful sleep). In the early morning, still lying in bed but awake, I started thinking about the anxiety symptoms I was feeling (upset rumbling stomach/stomach butterflies, feeling like pooping) and connecting them to what I've read on this subreddit and in other places before: my body/mind is in fight or flight mode because it perceives impending danger. So I wondered, not for the first time, what is it that I actually fear? What am I so scared of? What threat do I see?

What I came up with is that, for as long as I can remember, I've felt anxiety about doing things (like things all across the spectrum of activities, from cooking to working out to sports to doing homework to having conversations), and I think I experience fear about all of these varied things because (this is the big realization), for whatever reason, my sense of self worth is tied to the outcomes of all these things that I do. So if I go to cook something, for example, and it doesn't turn out the way that I hoped or expected, it's not just some small disappointment; my sense of my value as a person suffers. 

If my sense of my self worth was not impacted at all by the outcome of an activity, then I think it makes sense that I wouldn't feel anxiety about doing it in the first place because then the stakes really aren't that high (with the cooking example, the stakes are just the cost of the ingredients, the time you spent that could have been spent on something else, and maybe some other potential consequences that I'm not thinking of; none of these seem like survival-threatening concerns that would trigger intense anxiety symptoms). But if my sense of my self worth is at stake, then I think I can understand why I feel those symptoms of anxiety (upset stomach, stomach butterflies, other symptoms). It IS a big deal and it IS scary to potentially lose your sense that you matter and that you are valuable and that you should exist. Believing that you are bad or don't have value can lead to worrying that others will treat you as such, that you won't belong anywhere, then maybe depression sets in. So lots of painful stuff. 

I want to figure out how to make my sense of self worth an unconditional thing, as opposed to it being tied to the outcomes of moment to moment decisions and actions, because then maybe I won't feel such uncomfortable anxiety symptoms in response to non life threatening, daily choices. If you read this, thank you. If you can relate, if you have thoughts or advice, anything on the subject of anxiety and one's sense of self worth, I'm open to hearing it and hopefully learning from what you think. Thanks ??"

I think I have decided to take the glass of wine, because I have never tried alcohol before, and therefore do not have an addiction; but the reason I haven¡¯t tried alcohol until now, is some history with addiction in my family, and a feeling of easily getting addicted to stuff.

I keep trying to remind myself that hardly anyone has their shit together at my age, yet everyone around me talks about many of their life-changing experiences and opportunities that are either so far away from being achievable in my situation or just too late for me to experience and have the same emotional impact or opportunistic moments as they did for others. 

Case in point being romantic relationships, work placements, career advancements, and just an overall good quality of life. All of these things are completely affected or outright unobtainable because my autism and lack of finances, professional experience and social skills are hindering me to this current low point in my life.

My anxiety feels justified and I spend an exorbitant amount of time on reading and thinking in order to mitigate disaster scenarios.

anxiety,TheGreatCamG,2020/3/1,"Anyone else ever experienced the symptom of being unable to swallow food? First time poster here. For months now I¡¯ve been dealing with anxiety symptoms prominently centred around not being able to swallow food down. A few years ago with this first happened to me I had several tests done to see if there was any physical ailment surrounding it but any doctor eventually attributed it to issues of anxiety - the symptoms eventually disappeared and I was feeling great for a few years, but roughly 6 months ago they returned and have progressively getting worse. It¡¯s as if any time I start getting a bit into a meal, I completely lose the ability to perform the swallowing motion and feel like I¡¯m choking, like the food won¡¯t be able to go down, etc. Today was particular horrible as I could only get a few bites into a bowl of ramen before having to throw it out. Now, the only times I really find myself able to comfortably finish an entire meal without issue is after a night of drinking with friends. The inability to have proper nutrition has only exasperated the symptoms as going hungry and only being able to comfortably eat pur¨¦ed soups makes the general anxious state of mind worse.
On Friday I went to my family doctor and she gave me resources for finding a therapist and said if the symptoms persist she would be comfortable prescribing me an SSRI, which I am hesitant to jump right into without first trying therapy it but am strongly considering it now after a particularly horrible week. I¡¯ve spoken to many friends about anxiety issues before, but none of them have shared this same symptom to the same degree as I have. Is there anyone here who has experienced this as well and was able to overcome it / has any strategies to help cope with it? I live in a pretty cold climate at this time of year, and with winter winding down I¡¯m hopeful I¡¯ll begin feeling normal again before too long, but I feel awful now much of the time and want nothing more than to just be able to take down a huge meal without anxiety. I¡¯m getting sick of only being able to eat soups and things you don¡¯t have to chew."

anxiety,DarkBlocklandGuard2,2020/1/10,"Been very anxious about ""Meme Magic"" and something called ""Virus 23"", can anyone help alleviate my fears? Recently, I've been pretty paranoid about something called ""Virus 23"", which is apparently something about Meme Wars and cultural stuff. I've read about it on several 4chan threads, and apparently it's a mind controlling tool used by the government to brainwash people. There's also two Reddit threads about it, one of which is on the Sorcery of the Spectacle board, which apparently deals with meme magic. I decided to look into meme magic, and what I saw horrified me. Apparently, people can just think up of whatever they want and they can just manipulate reality, possibly maybe even destroy it. I thought the ability to manipulate reality in supernatural ways was crap that literally only existed in fiction, but now that I found out that it's probably real, reality got a little bit more scarier to me. Not helping to ease my fears is that there doesn't seem to be any attempts to debunk meme magic.

This is my second time I've posted something on Reddit, and if you've looked at my posting history, you'll know that I have a phobia of SCP-like Memetic Hazards possibly existing IRL. I still have bad impulses to search ""4plebs /x/ paranormal memetic hazard"" because I want to know if there are any that exist, despite knowing the consequences. The reason why I do this is because I might think up of something scary, like a mind virus, and then me constantly thinking of it will put it in reality. Honestly, just typing this up is putting me at unease, and I also might have another anxiety that you guys might try to say that this isn't real just to make me feel better and not being sincere. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please, I just want some re-assurance that nothing is wrong and life is good. I just want to be re-assured that Virus 23, meme magic, and memetic hazards aren't real. I just want to be me again, before I got paranoid over memetic hazards back in September of last year."

I havent told anyone, the only person who even knows I have a hard time with school is my counselor when I broke down infront of her a few months ago, and even then I didnt tell her nearly how bad it gets. I didnt tell her that every day, On the way to school, on the way to  class, even just walking to my car, I get a really bad anxiety attack. It got to the point last year where I missed hundreds of classes, and up until recently couldnt make it through a full day without skipping one or more classes. Lately I've been going to class, and it's gotten just slightly better, but its still bad enough to where if I'm even a minute late, I just wont show up. 

This is just the anxiety side of things, I wont go into the depression aspect, But its twice as bad, and that's a whole different battle that I'm slowly working on. But I want to fight my anxiety issues, I love learning, I love meeting new people (even though its extremely hard because of my social anxiety) and I'm sick of not being able to enjoy these things. I don't want to tell my parents, They're going through some really tough times right now and I dont want then to worry anymore than they are.

I'd mostly be using it to treat GAD and SAD, although it'd be nice if it also helped with insomnia (I have a lot of trouble breathing at night (probably due to anxiety) and often wake up in a panicked state shortly after falling asleep and can't go back to sleep) and chronic pain (although I don't expect that to work as only opioids have for that). My psychiatrist mentioned I took a low dose years back with another doctor, but having exhausted almost all my medication options over the last decade, he said I could try it at a higher dose as an alternative to going back on olanzapine. 

I would have tried it at my last appointment, but I mentioned to him how I haven't felt safe driving anymore the last couple years (and one other issue related to when I went to the ER for a side effect that I fear will reoccur in public at certain times of day) so I didn't. I've been terrible without my olanzapine, so I'm thinking about trying Gabapentin for as long as needed at the appropriate dose and then going back on Olanzapine if it doesn't work, that is if he is fine with my primary care MD doing it since it's much easier to get there. It was nice getting a somewhat decent amount of sleep on the latter, but my anxiety only continued to get worse, restless legs were annoying, and I gained about 20 pounds on it (and have already lost 15 on the two months off)."

He occasionally has conversations with his Dad for some advice on life and how to use the power. One thing that his Dad said was to ""live each day twice in order to be truly happy: first, with all the everyday tensions and worries, but the second time noticing how sweet the world can be.""

That part just hit me so hard because I find myself lost in my own severe anxiety in a day where I either can't pay as good attention to my loved ones (e.g wife, close friends). I sometimes feel distracted or too stressed to take the time to actually show my love. When the day passes I always feel like I could have been more loving/caring than being stressed about 100 stupid things and regret that.

anxiety,Survector,2020/3/24,"ZMA + agmatine sulphate + Lion's Mane The above combo does wonders for my anxiety.

I usually try supplements for my insomnia, bur by coincidence I noticed it helped greatly for my anxiety. (especially when I just get out of bed, my body is icecold and I feel apathic &amp; anxious).

It's the same reason I take kratom, it does wonders for anxiety.

30 min. before I take kratom I take a combo of ZMA (contains Mg, an NMDA antagonist), agamatine sulphate and LM. The first 2 I take because they lower tolerance of kratom, and I add the LM that also helps with anxiety.

But what I noticed is when I take the combo first (before kratom) I it already helps greatly with anxiety, I suspect the combo works synergistic (if it didn't it would cancel out the anxiety effect of LM).

So perhaps this might be useful for people who also suffer from anxiety.

Just when I start to feel relaxed enough in my life (I have social anxiety), some kind of a tricky social situation happens (telling my teammates that I can't be part of a team anymore, telling my brother honestly that something he said hurted my feelings...) which I overthink a lot for at least a couple of days.
When I am forced to deal with situations like those I am afraid that I am going to really hurt someones feelings and that they will think I did it on purpose although I tried to minimize the consequences.

I understand that it's a main symptom (recalling and questioning a social event) of social anxiety, but I had to check if someone has some way of dealing with this terrifying feeling that someone thinks that I deliberately hurted his/hers feelings.

anxiety,cookieimpala,2020/2/24,"Sudden weakness/fatigue episodes for years; need advice I?ve been having anxiety for some years now (I could write a novel here about it, but I more or less managed to slowly get things better), but there is one thing that keeps happening to me since I was like 15 (now I am turning 27) and never really managed to ?fix¡° this issue; and I consider the worst and most unpleasant, crippling part of it. 

It?s like episodes of extreme fatigue and weakness that happen to me like once/twice in a month, and last usually 1 to 3 days (afterwards I usually wake up next day just being ok again). During that time, I feel dizzy, weak, unstable, irritated, like I can?t coordinate my arms and legs, I feel slow, lack of concentration, with slurred speech, out of breath, I feel like I need to sit / lay down all the time (and when I do, I actually start feeling better and my slurring speech gets gone) and my legs feel super stiff, sometimes when walking my legs even start to feel so weak and ?uncontrollable¡°, that I need to stop (would compare it to being really drunk).  
 I started to track those ?bad days¡° to try and find a pattern to when it occurs, but it?s not particularly tied to anything (yes, sometimes it happens when I?m stressed, but it also happens when I?m not / on vacation etc). The worst part of it is, when I am at work or traveling, I feel like I can?t speak/think/walk...basically function properly.

Now, I?ve already been to MRI, CT, spine examination and neurologist in the past, but they all turned okay. I am going to a psychiatrist (now taking Sertraline because I?ve also been suffering agoraphobia), but he didn?t say that those symptoms can be directly from my anxiety (which is not severe). I am doing yoga and exercising pretty regularly, sometimes meditating, and even when it definitely has had some good impact on the anxiety, seems that it doesn?t have much effect on those ""attacks"". I?ve read a number of articles and seen videos, but it is so much information that it usually gives me even more anxiety and I can?t make sense of what can be the solution to this."

I¡¯m 20, still a virgin, struggled with depression and anxiety since around 16, starting to get my life back on track after being VERY socially isolated for about 3 years.

Basically, my point here is that when I have a positive and enjoyable conversation with a women, afterwards I tend to go away and completely overthink and over-estimate the value of the conversation. I put it on a pedicel, and start to think about what I did that made the conversation go well and prepare to replicate my body language and speech for the next encounter, which in turn makes me seem very awkward and weird; removing any previous positive aspects of our relationship. 

What can I do to limit the obsessive thoughts I have analysing our conversation?

I think it was Jane Austen who wrote in one of her novels that happiness is alwavs something that you are anticipating in the future, not something that you have right now.

It's just little things like this that trigger anxious thoughts. Even just asking for reassurance when I'm tasked with something is sometimes too much. Then I always rather do about nothing or with the extra anxiety of doing something wrong and have someone be mad at me than asking another time. 
But as I don't have panic attacks or something as severe, I always feel like my anxiety's not valid or worth any attention. My sister and two of my closest friends know this, but I don't see those friends regularly. So I always kinda hope my sis'll notice whenever I feel something in that direction.

anxiety,newsoberliving,2020/1/11,"Managing GAD while also having Bipolar II Hi everybody,

I have suffered from generalized anxiety disorder for much of my life as a result of trauma and an unstable childhood. I also have a family history of bipolar II and was diagnosed with it in 2017. My bipolar is in remission at this point thanks to medication and therapy, but I have been absolutely struggling to manage my anxiety.

I have tried a variety of medications, but since I have bipolar II SSRIs can make me extremely depressed and I am a recovering addict so benzos are not an option (not that I didn't try). I have tried to use beta blockers in the past, but they ultimately caused me too much fatigue and cognitive difficulty that I couldn't function while taking them.

I usually end up either overeating like crazy to stamp out my anxiety or starving myself for days at a time (did I mention I also have a history of anorexia?). I eat a vegan diet and mostly focus on eating healthy foods. I can fall off the wagon easily with this because eating manages my anxiety well.

I have experience with a variety of therapeutic processes to manage my anxiety, but even if I am able to identify and avoid anxiety triggers I still have a difficult time handling the symptoms. Basically I am at my wit's end.

I have tried to exercise, but a mixture of my eating disorder behavior which causes me to work myself to the bone in pursuit of an unattainable body image and my addictive behavior which causes me to become injured from excessive working out has made it feel impossible for me to do consistently. Does anyone have any experience coping with GAD while also having Bipolar II? I am pretty much willing to try whatever to manage it because overeating isn't working."

And i can kind of trace it back to my being bullied as a kid and feeling like i dont really have any control.
I just wanted to write it down, and maybe give a bit of hope to people who are considering getting help, but are on the fence. Do it.

anxiety,raspberrimax,2020/2/6,"Feel like I'm losing a grip on my life &amp; can't see any way out Originally posted this in the Agoraphobia subreddit, but thought it might be worth a shot posting it here too considering my fear is heavily Social Anxiety related (I also have GAD).

I've  been housebound for around about five months after I suffered a panic  attack that lasted about three hours that came relatively out of the  blue (I have never suffered one before). I'm on a gap year in which I  intended to save up more money for University (I am 19), but when I  tried to resume my normal life, going to work etc, I just suffered more  &amp; more attacks until it got to a point where I couldn't even get  down my road. I've been so, so desperate to get to University (to study  History &amp; Politics), but right now it seems completely out of the  question as I have made little to no progress &amp; have about five  months to get to a place four hours away &amp; to start to move into a  new place, alone.

I'm  definitely at my absolute lowest point, I am extremely depressed,  especially when I think about the prospect of not having the opportunity  to do something people hold as some of the most important &amp; fun  years of their lives. None of my friends know that I am agoraphobic,  &amp; I am way too embarrassed/self-conscious to tell them, I just make  the excuse that I'm ill. I have missed out on so much, not being able to  see my friends, missing their birthdays, missing family gatherings, I  can't see my Dad because of a recent separation &amp; family turmoil  &amp; it looks like I won't even be able to attend my own Grandad's  funeral about which I feel incredibly guilty (he recently passed away) -   I used to be somewhat socially anxious, but still loved going on  nights out &amp; meeting new people. I feel like I have been completely  robbed of such an important part of my life &amp; still get consistent  panic attacks every day at home - nowhere feels safe to me. I also  suffer from derealisation &amp; depersonalisation which has led me to  convince myself I'm in a coma dream or something similar. I'm isolated  in my bedroom for pretty much nine-tenths of the day &amp; feel like I'm  going insane. I know people have it worse &amp; don't want to play the  victim card, but I am at my absolute wit's end.

I  have been waiting for help for the entire period of being housebound  (I'm still waiting now), the only thing I've been prescribed is Diazepam  (which I now hate taking because of the consequences &amp;  addictiveness) &amp; the only help I've been offered is three CBT  telephone sessions, with the deal being afterward I would have to go to  the place &amp; continue sessions by going into the place, which seems  like a big leap. Even if that did help, the problem is that the wait  time is 16 weeks minimum. For a while I did try to take things into my  own hands, doing affirmations, meditation &amp; mindfulness &amp; trying  to slowly expose myself outside my house again, but every time I tried,  an attack or overwhelming dizziness would completely set me back to the  point where I have lost all motivation.

In  this period of time, my health has been rapidly deteriorating it feels  like. I smoke &amp; the only way for me to justify going into my garden  &amp; getting outside is to have a cigarette, which has led to me  smoking lots more than I used to &amp; my diet has become awful because I  get so dizzy when I'm anxious (which is basically always), so I have  not been able to cook for myself properly at all &amp; don't want to put  pressure on my family to make it for me, leading to me just eating  ready food, which I used to completely oppose! I have also not been able  to properly exercise (whereas before I played sports, walked everywhere  &amp; generally exercised daily) because increased heart rate triggers  my anxiety &amp; I have been escapist drinking. Ironically I absolutely  loathe myself for making these decisions.

I  can't wait much longer, it completely feels like my life has come to a  total end, I can't see or imagine any way out of this situation.

I'm  not sure what I expect from this, in some way it's nice just to write a  lot of it up - if anyone has any advice whatsoever I would be eternally  grateful."

anxiety,OMGBoobsLOL,2020/1/6,"I've been doing breathing exercises at least once a day since January 1, 2019. I challenge you to work on using techniques such as breathing control, meditation, or visualization to help combat anxiety attacks in 2020. Short story: I've been struggling with anxiety for a hot minute, and have frequent flare-ups in social situations as well as when I think too heavily about things that stress me out in my day-to-day life. 

Around this time last year, I was working to find a way to help combat these issues and stumbled upon practices that are very beneficial from r/meditation , and have since allowed myself to work towards forms of mindfulness and breathing meditation practice. 

I've found that trying different techniques of this sort have helped me slow down and relax in nearly any situation I find myself falling into fear with. 

I used to have problems being around my family, and though I still struggle with them and their ideologies, I can help myself stave off any attacks I might begin to encounter when in contact with my family.

I also have issues in big crowds, and as a student in college, I have massive lectures that literally drive me to madness. I've begun practicing these meditations prior to and before my courses that stress and scare me, and I've been able to combat the issues I had through my freshman and sophomore year this far.

Other days it was difficult, and I had to leave rooms to separate myself from the situations, but upon this, I eventually found myself calm and collected. 

Even if it's once a day, please try to slow down your breathing, eyes closed, world off. Slow in, slow out. I've come to most enjoy a pattern of 6 seconds in, 3 seconds held, and 6 seconds out, but some people prefer otherwise, and it's whatever works best for you. 

Along with breathing exercises, practicing meditation has helped me combat my anxiety problems to this point and I'm going to continue working to break the hold anxiety has had on me for years. 

I sincerely hope this helps anyone who struggles with crowds and breathing in certain situations similar to mine. 

Much love, and best of luck &lt;3

anxiety,Azmosam,2020/3/15,"My course will require me to travel to Japan for months, not sure how I will cope I don't want to write a massive wall of text so I'll try and keep it short. Basically, I have decided that I want to learn a language as part of my degree, and one of the few courses still available to me that I find interesting is a Japanese studies course, except on the third year it requires me to travel to Japan to study for a number of months.

I really want to travel and Japan would probably be my number 1 destination next to America, (im from the UK) except to get to Japan it would require a 12 hour flight, and then I would effectively be ""trapped"" there until it's time to come home.


My two main anxieties right now are a type of Agoraphobia where I can get a bit nervous when I leave the house, and my main fear is that obviously living in a foreign country on the other side of the planet may awaken that anxiety to it's maximum.

I used to get daily panic attacks in 2018, until about september 2019, when I basically had enough control that I stopped getting them. I've been clean for a while now, but I still have those anxious thoughts non-stop, and I've come a bit close to panic a few times, but I believe I am able to control it. Despite this, I read about people who have panic attacks that last upwards of an HOUR, which is fucking mind blowing to me as mine only last about 3 minutes. So I'm afraid of somehow surviving the flight to Japan, only to suffer hour long super panic attacks like some of these people supposedly do. I also read how someone traveled abroad and a continuous panic attack for 2 days straight, just because she traveled abroad to another country. Now I don't think my anxiety is that bad, thank god, but I also have absolutely 0 experience living abroad, and I'v only ever been on 2 flights, to luxembourg and back, so my overall long-distance travelling experience is very limited.

Someone please give me some advice, or perhaps if you've had similar fears and survived, tell me about it please. I WANT to go to Japan, I just worry how well I will cope mentally, so many some inspiration will be enough. Also if you've managed to survive your anxiety disorder / beaten it entirely, maybe just write a comment and let me know as I think it will help empower me to get over mine, as I do believe I can beat it entirely given enough time."

anxiety,CaputGeratLupinum,2020/3/21,"Fever is gone, Shortness of breath is not My symptoms started in earnest this past Sunday, mild fever, chills, fatigue, and shortness of breath. I called my doctor that day, she said there's nothing they can do for a virus, I don't meet the criteria for testing, and if I really can't breathe go to the hospital.

Fever got worse and then better, had nausea and loss of appetite that got better, but today and especially tonight I still feel short of breath. I've also been battling sleeplessness pretty hard all week, and had some great success last night with guided meditation, but tonight every time the guide has me focus on my breathing all I can do is think about how it doesn't feel like enough.

I just texted the Disaster Distress Helpline, the woman who responded gave me some information on covid testing in my area after I assured her I don't meet the criteria."

anxiety,mak1017,2020/3/10,"managing anxiety during times of change I¡¯ve been managing my anxiety and overthinking pretty well using distractions, deep breathing, exercise, etc. But I¡¯ve got a big life changing decision to make in the near future and I can feel my anxiety level creeping back up very quickly, and my usual coping strategies don¡¯t seem to be helping. I tend to ramble, so I¡¯ll try to explain myself more concisely lol. Basically, I have to decide for sure if I¡¯m moving back home temporarily. I¡¯m currently living in my college town, but unemployment is high and my field is very saturated (and I¡¯m not that experienced), so it¡¯s been impossible to find a job in my field that pays a liveable wage. That being said, I¡¯m most likely moving back in with my parents for a year or two to give myself better opportunities for employment, and to help me meet my financial goals (pay off student debt, and start saving $ again). 

This probable life change is stressing me out already, and if I do move, it won¡¯t even be until the end of July. I don¡¯t wanna live the next 4-5 months with a lingering feeling of worry and stress. Especially if I AM moving, I really wanna be able to enjoy it and make the most outta my time before I leave. 

Does anyone have experience with managing stress and anxiety during times of change? I wanna be excited about where these opportunities could take me, but it feels impossible to do that when all I can think about is leaving behind my college town and everything I¡¯ve gotten so used to in the last five years."

anxiety,_comfortablydumb_,2020/3/21,"Coronavirus anxiety, need a change in mentality Hey, I know there's been lots of discussion about coronavirus, the pandemic, etc, and how to manage anxiety surrounding that. Anyone have any mentalities or thoughts I could use to get rid of my anxieties surrounding the virus? My anxiety is mostly stemming from the unknown, which I know is completely normal and human, but it's still uncomfortable. I don't know when the pandemic will end, I don't know when society is going to return to normal, it's all just really scary.

I've seen a lot of recommendations to distract yourself, and that works temporarily, but you can't distract yourself with a book or a musical instrument when you're laying in bed trying to sleep. I've also been trying to limit my exposure to media, especially fatalistic op-eds with fear-mongering titles. 

I'm also undergoing a sort of internal war between my rational side and my anxious, fear-induced side. My rational side says that the pandemic will pass eventually, that I will be fine and so will my family members as long as I social distance (which I'm doing). Everything goes fine, and I don't experience anxiety until my illogical side comes in and tells me that it's the apocalypse, millions of people will die, society will never be the same, that I have no future and should basically just bite the bullet and give up my dreams right now because it's the end of the line. 

I need a way to silence the illogical side of my brain, which always seems to take precedent--this fatalistic thinking. Hence the title of this post, I need a change in mentality, not some advice that simply says, ""pick up a new hobby!""

I appreciate anyone who takes time out of their day to respond to this. Thanks :)"

The line between reality vs. my negative interpretation of reality is starting to get quite blurry and I feel like I am an unreliable narrator at times.

anxiety,AMonsterMask,2020/1/7,"I need to quit my job over text today and I don't know how to do it. Basically, the store owners at this job were constantly yelling at me, one of them often got right in my face sometimes while yelling, and the other would tell me things that often made me feel self conscious, often right in front of the customers (like saying that I spend too long in the bathrooms, even when it's only been like 90 seconds, or that I need to shower/wash my clothes more because I have a *""bad smell""*).
  
  
They also watched me way too hard during my shifts, accused me of stealing on two occasions (I hadn't taken anything), and constantly told me that I wasn't doing my job right, even when I was doing it exactly how they showed me. They would sometimes ask me to do several things that *were not* my job, and then get mad and yell when my actual job wasn't getting done fast enough. 
  
  
They would also sometimes get mad on days where I wasn't saying much, if anything, because I was trying to focus on my tasks, and they would suggest that I didn't like them anymore, and that I was probably looking for another job. They would then start insisting that it was insensitive of me to consider leaving them, and that if I stay long enough, they might promote me to manager (they ended up choosing someone else, by my knowledge). All of this was prompted by me not speaking on some days or not laughing at their stupid jokes. 
  
  
They weren't acting this way with anyone else (I asked a few people, and they all said that the store owners were super nice to them). I was the only one, and since I was the first one to come in every morning (the other 5 morning shift people quit for one reason or another), I was the only one they interacted with for the first 5-7 hours of each day. I was being overworked and constantly harassed.
   
I often had bad mental breakdowns while there, and it often led to physical violence against myself (my family doesn't know this). I chipped a tooth hitting my head/face against a wall, I would accidentally cut my hands with knives almost daily because they would shake so much after a confrontation, and a few times, I did that thing where I kind of bit into my arm while nobody was looking to kind of keep myself from yelling or crying, but I did it way too hard and ended up leaving swollen bruises on my arms. They didn't necessarily hurt, but they were still hard to hide, or hard to explain if someone saw it. 

My dad and I decided that this wasn't really a good job to have, and that the store owners were being really unfair. 
  
  
Thankfully, I have a new job now, and I officially start tomorrow, but I have to resign from this other place now, and, since they kept accusing me of quitting and saying that I had better not quit, I didn't really get a chance to put in my notice of resignation or anything like that. I'm genuinely afraid to go back there and be yelled at more, or get into an argument and be convinced to stay. So now I'm basically left with the option of quitting over text or email, and then blocking the number so I don't have to see their reply. 
  
  
The only problem is that I have no idea what to say, or how I can make it seem like my resignation isn't personal. I'm genuinely nervous, and I didn't get much sleep at all because I'm worried about how I'll do this. I have until the end of the day, which is already halfway over, so that they can at least find someone to cover my shift for tomorrow."
anxiety,brewskeet,2020/1/5,"Anxiety stomach during vacation I have been discussing with my therapist about how to be okay with having free time, because I usually guilt myself about not being productive and get sick (headaches, migraines, indigestion, stomach cramps).

I recently came back from vacation at a resort. My partner had the exact same foods and drinks as me, I have no allergies, yet I¡¯ve been having stomach problems for 5 days (3 during the trip and 2 since back, ongoing).

anxiety,wordpasd,2020/3/29,"Nearly paralyzed with fear and scared to make the wrong decision due to anxiety. Teladoc reported my daughter's (10) injury (large bruise on back of left hand caused by being hit with a ""wooden pole"" for stealing food. This is the second time on the same hand, according to daughter) to CPS and instructed me to do the same. After speaking with daughter and taking pictures of the injury, DHS social workers instruct me to file emergency motion to restrict parenting time against dad and not return the kids Monday morning, as obligated per current orders. They tell me they will be filing a finding of child abuse and need to make sure kids are safe while completing investigation and writing the report. Their findings are based on daughter's statement and the mark on her body.

So much history but long story short, I took kids and left ex due to mental/emotional abuse of me and our eldest (then 15, now 21). Court and ""experts"" don't believe me, find I'm the problem, give ex full decision making and 80% parenting time. Most recent attempt for more parenting time ended in no change in time and I'm ordered to pay approx $20 or 30k for his attorney fees. That was in January and things at their home have escalated based on what kids are telling me and  daughter was placed on suicide risk by school while waiting for the judge's decision.

My attorney is strongly advising against keeping the kids with me or filing anything until we have the DHS report. If the pattern of this custody battle continues, she believes the judge could likely dismiss the incident as corporal punishment, order him not to do it again, then take away my 20% time because my motion will be viewed as a power grab because I didn't like the findings in January. Another possibility is that the social worker will change her mind about what happened when she interviews dad and stepmom, which is exactly what happened with the last investigation. 

Then there's the whole virus thing going on and pressure from work and money and... And... And.

What the fuck do I do? I'm terrified to make the wrong decision out of fear either way and the anxiety of all of this is making it nearly impossible to do anything."
anxiety,cogguynito,2020/2/29,"Don't fight it I'm sure I'm not the only one whose instinct on feeling an attack coming was to try to fight it: brace for the coming storm, grab any safety crutches I have, plan my escape route if needed. While these can be useful behaviours at first in helping you return to doing things you want to do, one realisation that really helped me was that it can be much better if you don't fight it.

Anxiety and panic attacks are just your over-zealous brain looking out for you. If you fight it, you are confirming subconsciously that there was indeed a threat, and reinforcing the anxiety cycle. If however you reach a point where you accept the feelings, acknowledge them for what they are but know that you do not have to act on them, you will begin to re-wire your brain to learn that there was no serious threat. The aim is to break the feedback loop which confirms each ""threat"" and ensures another attack next time.

Obviously not everyone will be at a stage where it is possible to go out and make peace with these feelings right away, but it might be useful to see the endgame and know that there will be a time when you can come to accept them."

I wanted to share this bit of information paraphrased from a book excerpt my psychologist gave to me to read. It completely changed how I view panic attacks and the feeling of losing my mind/going crazy:

When you¡¯re having a panic attack, your body truly feels that there is significant danger present, and it gets ready to save your life from the threat, which of course doesn¡¯t exist. When your brain can¡¯t find a physical threat in your surroundings, it turns inwards: it rationalizes that if there¡¯s no physical threat, it must mean that there¡¯s something wrong internally, you must be losing your mind or there must be something wrong with your body. None of this is true, of course, it¡¯s your brain trying to rationalize and figure out why you are panicking. 


This completely changed how I view my panic attacks (and truth be told, I have only had a couple of extremely minor panic attacks since starting therapy and medication) - I feel completely normal again 99.9% of the time, and have complete confidence that I am in a place where panic and anxiety will never rule my life again."

 I've felt persistent anxiety and elevated heart rates in the daytime (palpitations even), somewhat ""wired"" in the daytime, sometimes trouble sleeping - all since about day 3. 

Does this seem unreasonable to expect withdrawals even as someone who does not drink and only recently began, or is this possible?

alcoholism,galacticspacewitch,2020/2/19,"Alcoholic Brain and Medication Info Disclaimer: Not a doctor, but wanted to share some of what I have learned about the alcoholic brain and medications that are being used to assist in recovery

The Alcoholic Brain: 
PET scans have shown that alcoholic brains show a decreased metabolic rate compared to non-alcoholics of the same age--depending on length of use and other factors. This just means that the brain has adapted to the chronic presence of alcohol, and *in the absence of this addicted ingredient* the neurons of the brain become somewhat less efficient in terms of metabolism. The good news, is that with prolonged abstinence, the efficiency returns to the same as those of non-alcoholics of the same age. (Picture: https://www.medicalimages.com/imagePreview/01B0W88C?imageId=22449239&amp;imageCode=01B0W88C&amp;contributor=ISM&amp;siteName=www.medicalimages.com&amp;title=&amp;location=&amp;ds=800&amp;newStyle=1&amp;tc=FFFFFF&amp;tbc=333333&amp;qv=95&amp;icc=1&amp;cl=1)

Medical Management: 
Medication is not for everyone and obviously should be discussed with a doctor. But here are some of the options that are currently being used to treat folks like us. 

-Naltrexone 
Naltrexone is a mu-opioid blocker that blocks endorphins. Endorphins are actually thought to play a large role in the process of cravings in the rewards center of the brain (Nucleus Accumbens). Naltrexone can be taken as a once daily oral medication, or as a shot once a month by the name: Vivitrol. Folks who take this medication sometimes report dry mouth, insomnia, or other side effects. 

-Acamprosate 
This medication can help with cravings by a different mechanism; it works to help balance out the neurotransmitters GABA and glutamate. During drinking days, GABA used to be increased. According to opponent process theory, ""what goes up must come down"" in a way, so early sobriety often entails an opposite shift of low GABA and high glutamate. 

-Disulfiram 
Most folks probably know this one. It blocks the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, causing a rapid build-up of acetaldehyde in the presence of alcohol. Should one drink while taking it, within 10 minutes a classic and terrible reaction occurs including face flushing, rapid heart rate, and vomiting. The concept is to recondition oneself to associate alcohol with the nasty consequence. However, this medication is falling out of favor because the reaction can be deadly.

alcoholism,DionRifkin,2020/2/18,"Even if you feel like you could quit drinking, how do you get past the notion that there is literally nothing else in life that can provide any sort of satisfaction? Title kind of says it all.  I drink on average 4-6 drinks daily, but can pretty often cut myself off at 2.  I¡¯ve started to recognize that my health is far less than perfect, the regular hangovers are debilitating, and I don¡¯t really enjoy it the way I used to.

But even in making several half-baked attempts at cutting back or stopping all together and in realizing through reading TNM that a life without alcohol is very possible, the biggest hurdle that remains is that I cannot for the life of me imagine even the rosiest of circumstances providing the sense of ease and contentment that pouring a drink does.  

I¡¯m sorry if this post just sounds cynical, especially to those who are successfully making early strides, but I guess what I¡¯m trying to get over is how one (especially someone who¡¯s hardly ever known what it means to not be depressed) answers the question of ¡°what¡¯s the point?¡± when quitting would mean a life that¡¯s invariably just as unfulfilling but experienced in a body that¡¯s undeniably healthier but also more cognizant of its empty existence."

I have two young children, and my wife is not necessarily an active participant in their upbringing.  For example, my 6 year old asked her if she wanted to go lay in the bed upstairs because she's always laying down looking at her phone.  Additionally, when I have been able to not drink for an 'extended period' of time, there is minimal recognition from her part (not that she owes me that), so I fall right back into drinking to control my stress and anxiety, but, I need to take responsibility for my situation and not throw blame on her.  Through the years, I began to lean on liquor to calm my nerves, but I don't want to do that anymore.  I completely understand that wanting to be the best dad cannot live in tandem with excessive drinking, but I still cannot stop.  It breaks my heart when my kids ask for their mama, but she is emotionally unavailable, and I dont want them to look at me with that same level of disappointment.

I am just interested in seeing who else was in this position, and how you climbed out of it.  My kids should be enough motivation to quit drinking, altogether, but, for some reason, its not.

alcoholism,EvilOverseer,2020/2/26,"Can support groups do more harm than good? Ok so I have a brother whos a fairly heavy drinker when he can afford it. Every payday the first thing he does is go to the liquor store, buy a 12 pack and drink it, then a few hours later cab back to the liquor store for more. This can repeat upto 3 times a night until hes broke. My family that is familiar with his drinking (myself, my sister, and my mother) have stopped doing anything that will help him get alcohol in any way shape or form. For example we no longer lend him cash as we know where that will go, we don't give him lifts to the liquor store, etc. Now this is where the support group comes in, I'm not sure exactly what is said there although he has pridefully told me on more than one occasion that the group seems to boil down to patting each other on the back and making each other feel better about relapsing with regularity.

Last night my brother got paid so you guessed it, binge drinking going on as I type! Well today my sister called me and we got talking and my concerns about the 'support' group came forth, she went on to inform me how when drunk he has texted her to put her down because his group says his life would be perfect if it wasn't for her. He has said similar things to my mother, and on one occasion where I dared to stand up for my mom he said as much to me. What I'm gathering from him is that this group is enabling him where we have stopped, he gets to be the victim and we (his family) are the victimizers. I'm at wits end and can not take it much longer as I live with him, I have my own problems (severe depression) that require counseling for me to work through and he keeps adding to them to the point where half my sessions are working through what he keeps dumping on me.

My question is that is this a normal situation for support groups? Do they normally make things worse before improving the situation? I mean I'm glad he's taking steps to deal with his problem but between the books they convince him to buy, the group itself, and the counselor he sees maybe once a month nothing is changing."

alcoholism,leaporlepor,2020/1/20,"What do do about my fathers worsening alcohol induced behaviour. My father is a chronic alcoholic and has begun to show increased aggression and some potential signs of alcoholic dementia. I have serious concerns that he could harm himself or someone else. My mother has already left him due to his constant verbal abuse and now my sister is baring the brunt of his behaviour. 

He is always screaming and shouting and my sisters older son has started saying that he doesn't like his grandpa. We have not long found out that he has definitely been drink driving when he has had my sister and her children in the car and that he has stolen alcohol from other peoples houses when visiting. He has also recently completely lost all control and threw things at my sister whilst she was holding her baby but fortunately she managed to turn so that nothing hit him.

She doesn't have anywhere else to live and she is scared that if she does eventually move out that father will kill himself but she is also terrified that if she calls the police that social services would get involved. After the most recent bout of bad behaviour, mother and I are concerned about the safety of my sister and her children. We tried to speak to his doctor but he cannot take a verbal report of this.

We are at a loss of what to do. If we call the police all hell would break loose, although in the long run it might do some good. I've also been considering writing a letter detailing fathers behaviour and addressing it to his doctor in the hope that he might be able to do something, although I'm not entirely sure that it would come to anything.

My family are at their wits end and we don't know what to do. Anything we've thought of would definitely cause father to go ballistic although I've reached the point where I would do it and take full responsibility and make sure that father knows that I'm to blame. 

Currently he is spending over ?100 a week on alcohol and has got into serious debt because of it. He needs help but won't even listen if anyone makes even the slightest mention of him having an issue with drink. I know that mother is trying to convince my sister to go to the council and see if she can get emergency accommodation.

The therapist he goes to warns him that therapists are legally required to report substance abuse because of his profession, so he decides to deal with it on his own.

Is there any way for pilots to seek professional help without losing their job, or is he pretty much stuck with off-the-books, AA-type organizations for support?

I am ruining my relationship with my girlfriend of 13 years because of how combative, stupid and sensitive (yet simultaneously insensitive) I become when I drink. I have no off switch, so even when I intend just to have a few beers, I end up going out and drinking 12 or more pints by the end of the night, starting some stupid shit, embarrassing myself and waking up feeling like a moron and trying to reconstruct what the hell I did the night before.

I've reached my breaking point, and I can no longer justify drinking AT ALL because sooner or later it turns out the same way all over again.

About 3 days ago, I decided to take a break from constantly drinking with other guys in the fraternity and I¡¯ve seen drastic improvements (no more dizziness, more focused, all without any noticeable withdrawals).

However, the main thing I realize now is I kind of began to rely on alcohol to fall asleep.

I took responsibility for my past decisions though and they're constant reminders of why to stay sober which was going well until she returned into my life. I've finally got myself under control the last couple years and without support which sucked. My parent however has not learned a single thing or has taken responsibility for anything in her life even now in her fifties. Not even a month out of rehab recently(one of the best here and post graduation professional help offered) and shes as bad as ever and has tried dragging me down along several times already which she succeeded in twice. It's gotten to the point where our family gatherings are done in secret cause no one wants to deal with her causing a drunk scene which also means we can't invite the one sibling who still supports her either cause of the same drama.

alcoholism,PrestigiousGoose0,2020/4/13,"Where to go from here Hi, I'd really appreciate some insights on my situation, and sorry if my english is subpar.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week, my girlfriend told me she was worried about my alcohol use. In the last 3-4 months, I've had a rough time, college decided to kick me out despite proving good grades like they asked last semester, ended up losing my student job and my laptop was accidentally destroyed, which contained a lifetime project. I slowly fell in a pattern of drinking maybe 4-6 days a week to help me calm down my anxiety and sleep easier. Of course, as I felt better in the last weeks, I didn't lose this bad habit as I was used to it.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend confronted me about this and I immediately told her I'd stop from now on. So for the last 7 days, I stopped drinking, and suffered through a mild withdrawal, feeling better every day. However, to help me cope with the withdrawal, I chose to chat and game with friends. They all are drinking most nights due to the quarantine, and it's slowly making me crave beer more and more every night. The thing is I use these games and chats to think about anything else than alcohol. I don't want to tell my friends, because I fear they will change how they act around me and how they see me.

&amp;#x200B;

So now for my question : More and more I feel like I'm growing more anxious to be exposed to the envy of having a beer, and I'd like to try to drink more casually, but this worries my girlfriend, who fears I might relapse. I don't want to isolate from my friends, since it's the only thing that helps me power through this, but I feel like I just quit drinking coffee, and every day I'm being shoved coffees in my face more and more and it's increasingly difficult. I intend to eventually drink beer casually like I used to and I think I have the willpower, but I thought quarantine was going to be helping me quit alcohol for a while, like a month, and I'm concerned with the fact that my main solution of gaming and chatting is exposing me a lot more to drinking than my social activities. before the quarantine.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I crazy to think I should tamper gradually with my withdrawal? I quit alcohol because I couldn't quit on my own bad habits and my girlfriend noticed me of it, so I fear my judgement might be clouded, I'd appreciate some insight.

Thanks"

alcoholism,danknugsukco,2020/4/8,"I'm 23 years old and don't know how to get help due to the COVID-19 pandemic Around 3\\4 years ago, I slipped in to deep depression after the death of a number of many people I loved within a short period of time. This resulted in my recreational use of drugs turning in to serious addiction, which resulted in me being hospitalized twice from use of ketamine.

Since then I have made substantial recovery, mentally, physically, socially (regained a lot friends), and also my career is going extremely well. However, a few months back I realized that I had replaced my usual addictive habits for alcohol.

I always drank in excess, but when consuming benzo's, ketamine and other substances in excess daily, alcohol did not cross my mind as being a part of the problem.

I now realize although I have made a lot of progress, my relationship with alcohol is extremely unhealthy. I think in the past 2 years I have maybe not drank 20 days in total. I regularly drink alcohol in the day, I have regularly felt the need to drink alcohol to elevate a hangover, and in trying to quit alcohol thinking that I could easily I have faced physical and psychological symptoms (sweats, shaking, depression, sickness, unable to sleep etc) which has always resulted in me buying more alcohol and feeling very guilty about it. (I have spent thousands of pounds on the stuff over the years)

I spoke to a doctor to arrange sessions in the hope to get a prescription for antabuse, but now that the recent virus outbreak has occurred I don't think that it is possible.

I don't know what to do, I feel stupid saying it but I can't stop. I really want to stop drinking, I wish it never fucking existed, but I can't stop. I'm functioning and I am doing well (self employed &amp; in university).. but I know deep down I am killing myself.

The fact is, if I keep drinking as much as I do now for the next 20 years, I will be extremely lucky to live past 50.

What do I do? I would really appreciate any advice."

There was a good stretch of a few months about 9-14 months ago when I didn't drink much, but since then it's been trying to not drink so much but ending up drinking around 20 drinks a week a more.

I drink coffee thinking it helps prevent liver damage and sometimes wallow in despair that I have ruined my body and mind from drinking so much. The depressing thoughts that I have drank away my potential and my health hit especially hard after that 2 or 3rd day of drinking straight with a foggy mind. I obtain supplements like DHM and sylmarin to prevent the damage I have certainly done to my liver, knowing there is no repairing the body from drinking this much. I feel my healthfulness starting to return after that day of abstinence and then letting myself believe my throat and stomach are fine after 2 days of rest. Forgetting that hope to abstain for at least 2 weeks, because I heard 2 weeks is enough time for the liver to fix itself usually. I'm 35 now and I've wanted to control my drinking since I was 27. From 22-27, I drank whenever I could as much as I wanted. From 20-22, I drank nearly every single night about .375 of hard liquor.

alcoholism,Motor-Photo,2020/2/29,"Alcoholic sibling / Friendgroup Hello all, my brother has drifted into heavy drinking over the past couple of years. I used to drink heavily and decided to quit about 4 years ago, i saw that i was heading towards problem drinking and stopped. I did not find it particularly difficult once i made my mind up but im sure if i had kept at it that could have been different. Now the thought of alcohol sickens me. I attribute it to finally seeing that alcohol was stealing my weekends and that it is really just a nasty drug that is somehow socially acceptable. Anyways my brothers and i friend group from growing up are all extremely heavy drinkers,  to be honest i was no angel but iam shocked at the amount they drink every day they seem to universally start drinking around noon and take back at least 10 drinks before i head out, i am sure they stay up much later drinking heavily. I have more or less cut that group out of my life as it is depressing and obnoxious to spend time with them.

My brother is extremely sociable and is either using socializing to cover unhealthy drinking or just naturally is social and drinks heavily while doing it. He has expressed interest in reducing his drinking or quitting which makes me really excited. Anyways my question is has anyone had any luck either waking up a group of people to how unhealthy and abnormal their drinking is? They are in their early 30s so in my estimation its way past youthful antics and more problematic, i havent really called them out on it. Also is it possible for someone who is trying quit / cutback to hang out with active alcoholics or heavy drinkers with out relapsing into heavy drinking? Because they have a group or culture of heavy drinking is it making it worse? It is very weird to live in a world outside of their drinking only to sociallize with them and be shocked. Maybe because they only spend time with heavy drinkers they dont see what everyone else does? It is really starting to affect their cognition and health."

The majority of them would be within a 2-3 hour period after I got home from work and before going to bed.

I've been having to deal with shakes,  night sweats and trouble falling asleep, as well as some nausea. Is there anything that can help me sleep more soundly, like taking melatonin? Will anti acid tablets help with nausea at all? I know theres no real way to decrease the shakes besides just slowly going through the taper.

I'm planning on using exclusively beer to taper, and am planning on starting at 9 over the course of the day today, and then decreasing by 1 every day for the next week (A lot of cites say you can decrease it by 2 per day safely, but Web MD has got me all sorts of paranoid).

I was hurt by his defensiveness and the way he was ok with distancing himself from me over alcohol. I know that it is a internal struggle for him and he has since apologized to me for getting too aggressive in our argument.

Around 5 years ago I started to notice that the day after socializing with a lot of drinking, my hangovers started to be different. No longer just body and head feeling shitty and nausea, now I started to get these intense, all night panic attacks. I'll just lie in bed trembling and sweating, and while I normally have an anxiety narration in the back of my head, now it starts getting too loud to ignore and often sounds like there is really someone in the room yelling or saying something into my ear. I also float in and out of short ""dreams"" but have trouble discerning them from reality. This usually lasts until 5 or sometimes 8am, at which point I can finally sleep for a couple hours. Some time ago a friend mentioned these symptoms sounded a lot like DT, and when I read about it I thought ""yes this is it"". However, all the literature I've read suggests you need to be drunk for several days on end, then quit for several days, then these symptoms occur. For me, it can be brought on by one heavy night of drinking followed by one day of not drinking (typically just focus on hydrating when I feel this shitty). Two days of binge drinking in a row guarantee I will get these symptoms, and I think severity scales with amount of drinks. Has anyone experienced this? Is there a way to combat it? Could I maybe have alcohol intolerance, or is this more related to my anxiety problems? I realize the smart thing would be quit or significantly reduce intake, and I may have to do that, but that would make my social life stressful and I may just become reclusive.

Recently I started working as a researcher for a series of documentaries about addiction for the Dutch public broadcasting (NPO3). That's why I'm looking for people who are addicted, or who recently stopped using.

We intend to follow a few people for several months, so we can (hopefully) give viewers a deeper understanding of what addiction actually means. Why do you choose to use, again and again, even when you don't intend to? And why is it so hard to stay sober?

In the end the viewer (hopefully) gets a personal insight in the lives of several people, and their relentless drive to numb themselves. The documentaries should present an unprejudiced representation of people who are addicted. We want to show that addicts are also plain people, although their lives sometimes maybe seems to be different.With these documentaries we hope to nuance the general knowledge about addiction, and to fight stigmatization.

The coming two months we are researching. We will try to speak with as many people as we can, to get a better idea of what is happening right now. So right now I'm just curious about your stories. The first contacts will stay private.

As it is right now I am drinking about 675-740 ml of Soju (20%) every night. Before moving to Korea I was just drinking enough cheap whiskey to make the room spin and knock me out for sleep. Ive been drunk every single night for about two years straight and I'm sick of how it is affecting my social life, work life, and my enjoyment. I've tried to cut back on drinking on my own countless times, but I've failed every time and only make it a few days before I'm drinking like I used to. I really need help on what to do if anybody can offer some advice. 

 For the past three months it feels like alcohol has been making things harder and harder for me. I have been canceling plans to go out in the evening because I start to seriously zone out and get anxious around 5:00 pm about being away from alcohol. I've had this constant brain fog for the past few months that only leaves me for maybe two hours a day. It feels like I'm not even fully conscious because it's so heavy and doesn't let me really enter reality. It sounds stupid, but its like there's this wall between me and other people that has appeared and I'm experiencing everything second hand. I get extremely tired to the point that my last two hours of work (I'm a teacher and right now we have a few more weeks before students come back because of COVID-19) are just me staring at my computer trying not to fall asleep. I've been getting headaches and chest tightness that doesn't go away until I start drinking again. At the same time my chest is tightening my heart just beats and beats and beats, but it all dissapears when I drink. 

Today I was going to visit a hospital to see about detox or medicine according to what I needed, but the friend who was going to bring me ended up saying it wasn't a good idea to go to the hospital. He is a coworker of mine who I trust, and his concern was that if I went to the hospital for a long time I may get the coronavirus and then bring it back to school for when the students come back. That would be horrible for the school's image and we would probably lose a lot of students from their parents pulling them out. I understood his point, but the virus will be here for a long time yet, and I desperately need to get my alcohol problem solved before my students come back. I can't keep pushing back the date on solving this because it is going to affect my classes too much. Every morning I'm hungover, and by 6:00pm I am a zombie. I'll be teaching kids from 9:00-6:00 every day during the times where I'm still partially drunk or craving alcohol.

Towards the end, he would threaten to kill me when he got drunk and we got separated when he actually pushed me down one time.  There was no particular reason, I never did anything to make him angry. When he was sober, he never acted like that, and he would say how much he loved me.  Now that we are separated, he talks about how much he loves me and wants to get back together, but I will never do that, because I honestly think he is one drinking binge away from actually killing me. But I just don¡¯t understand how someone can act so differently when he¡¯s drunk and when he¡¯s sober. What does he actually think, does he love me or does he hate me? Why would he say all those horrible things when he was drunk if he didn¡¯t mean them?  Thanks for any insights."

alcoholism,Approximate_Accuracy,2020/3/9,"What to expect going cold turkey? All advice is much appreciated Hello, fellow perseveres,

I have been self-medicating for PTSD, Panic disorder, Depression, OCD and ADHD for the past \~4 years. 

I guess I would fall into the category of ""functional substance abuser"" as I have been able to hold down a job and not let it affect my personal relationships too much. I developed Panic Disorder over a decade ago and have been on 5 mg diazepam/valium ever since. While it was not optimal, it allowed me to build a career and exit the house. Though sometime in early 2016 a myriad of unfortunate events culminated to the point where my mind ran amuck and I chose to deal with this by not dealing with it. I.E. substances.

For the past 4 years, my ""self-help regimen"" has consisted of 15-20mg valium, 10-20 cigarettes and between 5-8 beers (or equivalent in whiskey or wine) a day. While I never get inebriated to the point where I'm unconscious or puking, on the worst days I make stupid choices and suffer the consequences with a severe hangover the day after. Furthermore, I have recognized my cognitive abilities decline significantly in the last 1.5 years. My memory is so bad I almost forgot the word memory right now and the brain fog has become so thick that it's hard to articulate myself in conversations. In addition, my libido is non-existent, my angst is as bad as ever and my depression has consumed my life: If I don't feel the onset of a panic attack, I am simply numb throughout the day, to which my response is to drink. Drinking makes me feel **something.**

I woke up at 4 am tonight dehydrated from last night's alcohol and simply felt deep inside of me that I have had enough. This is not the first time I have told myself those words, but I am ready to try. I won't quit the benzos overnight due to the obvious dangers with that but would love any sort of feedback from people who may have worn similar shoes sometime in their life. Will quitting the aforementioned alcohol dosage cold turkey after 4 years pose a risk in terms of seizures? I am also curious as to whether I can expect to see my cognition improve at a recognizable pace (trying to find motivators to keep me straight), or is it more likely that I will get a lot worse before I get better?"
alcoholism,knockknockwhoisit,2020/1/8,"Probably a stupid question, but if you drink more, and faster, does your body still process it at the same speed? Story short, I have a job that's BAC level is 0, I've always worked off 1 standard drink per hour, but if more was consumed over a short ammount of time, does the body process it faster?"
alcoholism,HereForTheDough,2020/2/16,"My brother (24) is a very serious alcoholic. Looking for advice regarding interfacing with him. Alcohol abuse comes from 3 of our grandparents. He got it the worst, by far, out of 8 kids. He's the 5th. I'm the first. I am 10 years older than he is. I experienced similar drinking issues when I was his age, but they did not manifest in the outwardly malicious way that his are. He looks to me as a 'kindred spirit' because I drink too much, but without it having an overtly negative effect on my lifestyle or without it impeding my obligations. I am aware that some people will want to make this about my drinking, but it really isn't outside of my brother using me as a poor example to justify his own habits.

He married his high school sweetheart after impregnating her when he was a few years ago when he was 22. At that point he'd had no history of problematic drinking. By the time his daughter was born he had been hospitalized for drinking two or three times, arrested about the same number of times, and spent 30 days in VERY expensive in-patient rehab with daily psych visits. He got out and seemed to keep it together long enough to marry his wife and have his daughter. 

Since then he has been repeatedly hospitalized during drunk rampages, with levels as high as .40, which is supposedly fatal for amateur drinkers without serious tolerances. He is very talented as a drinker and has talked himself out of half a dozen circumstances where he was dead-to-rights drunk out of his mind and facing a DUI. He holds himself together in social situations the same way.

All of which is sort of fine. However, we've reached the point where he sends family group chat messages attacking my parents brutally on perceived flaws in their own lives. He attacks my mother for how he turned out and blames her, and he attacks my father for his lack of presence while he supported our large family. He says more brutally ridiculous things to them than I would ever tolerate without immediate violence from anyone else. I would rip out a stranger's throat for the things he says to my mother, which are all baseless, but which shred her emotionally. After a week or so he'll wrap up the bender and have a sick day where he seems to reflect on his texts from the week prior and apologize to everyone with a grand gesture.

We've been through this a dozen times over the past two years. I've tried being his friend and letting him relate his drinking to mine, even though that is without real merit. I've tried taking a hardline stance and ignoring him until he goes a month without an episode, but that month never comes and I break down and communicate with him again because I'm terrified of the remorse I will feel if he harms himself or someone else out of lonely desperation. He got wasted and tried and failed to hang himself with an appliance cord once already after nobody engaged his insanity.

What the fuck do I do? I don't drink with him or talk to him when I'm drinking. I have abandoned the idea of comparing my regular heavy drinking with his routine drunkenness and week-long benders. We tried to quit drinking together last year and I went 4 weeks before finding out he never quit at all. Is there anything I can do to help him? Do I just prepare myself for the upcoming tragedy? His wife is completely worthless and does nothing to fight his issues except to call us brothers or my father to deal with his violent rampages once he's gone too far. I'm at my wit's end and he's not even my brother having the worst problems with substance abuse."

alcoholism,looking4helpCA,2020/3/15,"Advise on avoiding withdrawal symptoms I'm seeking advise on how to reduce my withdrawal symptoms from alcohol.

I'm a 40 year old male who has been drinking in excess daily for about 8 years now (15-20 drinks per day). In the past I've gone through bouts of difficulty sleeping (night sweats, sleep paralysis), the shakes, and anxiety when cutting this down to under 10. I've been taking vitamins (and B-complex) for a number of years, but no drugs aside from caffeine.

My significant other is out of town on business every few months. I find myself getting excited about these times that I know he will be gone because this is how the process usually goes:
1) If I know he will be gone by the time I get off work, I have already made my mind up about what I am going to pickup on the way home to drink (recently switched from Bud Light to White Claw because I¡¯m believing the lie I tell myself that it isn¡¯t as bad for my health). I¡¯m excited about it literally ALL DAY and can¡¯t wait to get home and start feeling buzzed/drunk
2)I try to talk myself out of drinking that night multiple times throughout the day because I know I shouldn¡¯t, and I know I will end up feeling like shit the next day because I have trouble stopping after ¡°just a few¡±
3)step 2 goes out the window the second I start the trip home and pull into the gas station for my drink of choice
4)immediately chug 2 cans when I walk in the door to ¡°get it going¡± quicker
5)after about 4-5 more I¡¯m pretty intoxicated and switch from drinking to binge eating whatever sounds good at the time
6)call hubby and tell him I had 1 drink and a salad
7)full as a tick and drunk as a skunk I shuffle to bed and fall asleep
8)repeat steps 2-6 the next day if I know I will be home alone 

I do not drink every night and I have never been to therapy related to my drinking habits. I know this pattern of behavior is likely a good indicator of a substance abuse problem. I guess what I really want to know is does anybody experience similar feelings when it comes to drinking.... if so, how do you not give in? I know it¡¯s bad for me and I keep doing it. Tonight he is out of town again ??"
alcoholism,esetting,2020/1/12,"Needing advice from those who have gotten sober I'm going to try and keep this brief, even though things always are complicated. My Aunt is an alcoholic and has been for 24 years. She is like a mother to me. Some very basic background is my family is VERY involved in one another's lives and I don't think their methods of support have been ideal, but as someone who has never faced addiction or rehab, I would like to know the thought's of those who have been through it and can see this situation more clearly. After 24 years, my aunt transitioned from a functioning alcoholic to a non-functioning alcoholic. She was content with her drinking problem until this happened, and was very self-aware about it. She called me and told me she intended to stop drinking, and on the first of the year (Jan 1st, 2020) would start attending AA daily. This was her own decision, as my family stopped trying to convince her to do anything a very long time ago. They even drank with her on holidays and at dinners. She attempted to quit New Year's Eve and decided to not go out. 

She was immediately sick, had horrible cravings, and called my (actual) mother. My aunt said she didn't think she could get through detox alone and that she felt horrible and wanted to go to rehab. They couldn't get her in anywhere that night but found one for the following day (new year day.) She called me and told me she wanted to go in for the Detox process, which she thought might last around 5-7 days. She did. On the 7th day, my mom and another aunt (lets call her P) visited her and she wanted to leave. P and my mom made the decision to rush out and leave her there without telling her they were leaving. Since then, my entire family has been trying to make decisions for my aunt. My grandfather, whom they are all very incredibly close with and see weekly, decided she should stay 28-90 days and should have no contact with her, and P agreed. 

They think isolating her and not seeing her will make it easier for her to want to stay in rehab. Meanwhile, I told my mom I disagreed and that my aunt would need support. Today, my mom visited again and my aunt has been there for two weeks exactly. My aunt had her bags packed and expressed to my mom that she wanted to go home, and that she never signed up to stay for 28 days, that she just wanted to come in on her own accord to detox. She explains that she wants to stay with my mom, go to AA meetings daily, and get on a new routine. My mom called me in a panic and asked what she should do when my aunt asked her to take her home (to my mom's house,) she's now concerned that visiting her did make her want to leave. I told my mom to talk to her, and try to see if my aunt thought staying in rehab would be in her best interest, and if my aunt didn't agree, then I thought it would be better to take her home. 

The reason I think this is because my aunt can check herself out on her own at any time, and has not. She can call a cab and do whatever she likes. What I don't want is for her to feel alone, and abandoned, and do something like leave and go to a bar, or even just feel she has nowhere to go at all. My mom went in and spoke to her, and my mom needed to rush to a job interview directly after and told my aunt she wouldn't have time to take her home today anyway and to stay for one more night. So my question now is what does anyone on this forum think about this situation? My mom is dependant on me for answers on this, and the rest of my family seems forceful about just this one option of rehab. If she left early she would not have support from them, and I do think they would make her feel worse, which would ruin the transparency my aunt has been trying to have with them. 

My aunt expects to hear from my mom tomorrow, and I truly don't know what to do. At this point, I think my mom should pick her up tomorrow morning and help her find local meetings, take her to them daily, and have my aunt get a counselor outside of rehab that can help her with short-term and long-term goals. I think my mom should establish a level of openness with my aunt so that if my aunt ever does feel overwhelmed by her triggers, she can tell my mom that she may need actual time in rehab outside of detoxing. I just don't think attempting to force her to stay there will result in her truly learning anything. But I could be wrong. PS my family lives on the East Coast and I live on the West Coast. That's why this has been something my mom has had to do on her own. If I was there I would absolutely be the one handling all of this. My aunt and I's connection is incredibly deep, and I'm the one she calls when she needs to vent, get advice, etc. If anyone has any advice at all on my current thoughts, please let me know. Thank you!"

alcoholism,TaxiFare,2020/1/20,"I finally convinced my mom to go to rehab in a very unfortunate way She has been an alcoholic for a long time. Attempts to talk to her haven't really worked out so I began to read up on how to go about talking to someone with alcoholism about quitting. I begin to focus very hard for several days on the physical aspect of alcoholism, and not just how much it has hurt her social life. I managed to get a lot of things about alcohol dependance memorized along with mapping out her consumption in magnitude of ways. 

It ended with me studying up on liver sirrhosis and running down a number of different studies and articles about it. I ran her and her consumption through all of it and it's... not good. I found a way to get her to go to rehab, except at the cost of having to break the news that her liver could shut down at any moment. 

At first during the conversation when I was running down some numbers, she said ""Alright, I'll cut down on my drinking."" and it ended up with her having a panic attack, needing to lay down, almost vomiting, silently crying, and agreeing that the only option is detox and rehab.

alcoholism,alcohol-sucks,2020/2/9,"Considering finally leaving for real Hoping to get some support, maybe some advice. Excuse my incoherence, this is the first time I'm trying to summarize my situation like this and I'm keeping the story intentionally vague.

I've been with my current partner for over a year. We moved together few months into the relationship. They had their flaws, but I believed that they genuinely wanted and tried to fix the worst ones and we even got engaged. I've never had a relationship with a stable person, so I thought this is just normal partnership issues. They have a child from previous relationship which I gradually started taking care of and got attached to. Even though I've always feared having a child of my own, I could finally imagine it I could do it and it would even be great with this partner. They had a rough life, are diagnosed with a mental disorder and are in the process of detaching from their toxic family (which is a source of stress). I've started therapy and due to having to deal with my partner, I think I've become a better person, more understanding and tolerant, less egotistical.

The biggest issue is that they're an alcoholic. They know it, and since that one drunk night when they called off the engagement, they realized it's really an issue and they've started specialized therapy. But they make mistakes. I've been multiple times seconds away from ending it, but we always made it through somehow. Every time they drank, I had some excuse for them or they managed to say or do something that gave me hope. But lately I've been feeling like they're just going in circles and repeating the same mistake again and again.

I'm away for the weekend to visit my family. I asked my partner beforehand if they needed me to stay with them, but they said it's okay. We were texting the first night, they said they were struggling, but managing. Second day around noon, they text me they had failed and they understand if I want to move out. It did hurt, but after chilling out, I wrote they're a dummy and one well handled failure is not such a big deal. We had a really nice discussion about how they feel and everything seemed fine. They said they're getting someone to babysit to be able to relax and focus on their wellbeing. I voiced my concern about them being alone. They said they're not planning to touch alcohol. Then in the evening, they stopped responding to my texts (but they did read them). I'm almost certain they're having a drink night.

So here I am, so deep into the night it's almost morning and I can't sleep, my heart keeps beating like I just ran a mile, and I'm thinking through getting an apartment, wondering where I'm gonna live and store my stuff in the meantime, dreading being asked what happened by people I know, and trying to convince myself I'm not gonna stay alone for the rest of my life.

My partner says they love me and want me, but it's not enough for them to genuinely want to quit. We talked about that yesterday and it seemed like they were decided and excited to find their own way, but I don't feel I can take any more. I'm so angry, thinking of telling them they can't ever get any better if keep making such basic mistakes, telling them they'll lose their child this way and many more hurtful things."

alcoholism,valeriantincture,2020/1/28,"just wanted to share my story/situation I'm 22, female and live in Australia. I have been diagnosed in the last few months (several times by diff psychiatrists) with substance abuse disorder (pertaining just to alcohol, not other drugs), PTSD and BPD. I've been in complete denial about the ""substance use disorder"" diagnosis and was never willing to accept that my drinking was a problem. I even directly told this to the first psychiatrist who diagnosed me. I felt this way because I've been socialising for so long with people who drink heavily (but only socially) multiple times a week, and go on weekend benders. A lot of these people would drink from friday - sunday straight and take dexys to stay up.

Anyway, the thing that I've been in denial about is how physically reliant I feel towards alcohol and how often I drink alone, in the mornings, to avoid cravings. It's recently gotten out of hand and I don't feel remotely in control. I make so many excuses to myself about why it's ok for me to drink in that instance. I know I'm drinking to self medicate my PTSD symptoms. I'm a victim of pretty extreme child sexual abuse which I reported to the police 6\~ ish months ago, and making this reported ""triggered"" me to mentally spiral. I was drinking a lot before I made this report but would rarely drink in the mornings. Lately I've been showing up to work drunk, stealing my housemates' alcohol because I find it impossible to resist the temptation to drink when it's available to me. I can never have just one drink, or even just three. I always end up drinking until I throw up or pass out. 

I had an inpatient stay at a psych hospital for reasons not related to my drinking, and my GP thinks I now need to go back but this time for a detox/rehab program. I know my drinking isn't as bad as other peoples' stories I've read on here but I know it's only getting worse and worse and I'm trying very hard to get it in control before I spiral further. I don't want to go inpatient for my drinking because it would mean my family would know, and I feel very ashamed. I also have a family history of alcoholism on my dad's side and I feel like it would upset him to know I've also been affected by this.

I seriously feel like even though I'm ""functioning"" and doing most daily tasks I'm living a half-life, unable to pursue my interests or feel fully in control of my brain. I'm about to go back to uni this year and at this point I can't imagine successfuly studying while I'm struggling with alcohol so much. I also feel like I'm embarassing myself around other people a huge amount, and ruining my close bonds becauses of how often I forget how I conducted myself in a social situation.

Mostly just seeking general support and wanted to talk to other people about how I'm feeling, because I've been too ashamed to speak with people in real life.

alcoholism,djbrown92,2020/1/1,"The day I decided it was over Hey all! I am new to this community and so deciding to share my story, in the hope it can resonate with even one person who can relate! I am 27 years old, 2020 would have marked my 10th year of drinking. I have had a drinking problem since I was about 20 years old. Around this time I also developed generalised anxiety disorder and later social anxiety disorder (my drinking mainly contributed to this). For as long as I can recall I have always had underlying mental health issues, but these were completely manageable and didn't impact my life before I started drinking. It is almost impossible to take a step back and see the damage your drinking is causing you and those closest to you, because abusing alcohol completely robs you of your perception, any empathy for others and your sense of self, as well as money which you work too hard for to drink away to feel like crap anyway! I urge anyone suffering in a similar way to take that step back and use it as inspiration to make a positive change now! No matter your age no matter if you are in a better or worse situation than me! I have had 1 or 2 sober spells in the last 10 years of 6 weeks and 2 months sober, I felt so happy and free during these times, but always felt like I was missing something during it.. In hindsight I can say with absolute certainty that I wasn't! When I went back to drinking after these spells I hit it worse than ever. I did dumber shit and hated myself more and more. I've gotten into multiple fights when drunk (which is completely out of character for me), my fiancee left me months before we were due to be married because of my drinking, and I have lost many friends through actions and words used when I am under the influence. The day I decided it was over was just a few days ago at my friend's house, I completely blacked out and have no recollection, but suffered a head injury from a drunken fall. This caused a severe concussion and I have had to miss a week of a job I have just began and I'm now in danger of losing! I have decided once and for all I am never drinking again. I know for a fact that should I choose to drink ever again, it could be life or death, I will never be the guy who can just have 1 or 2 drinks I always feel I need to get shitfaced! I have subconsciously been waiting on a wake up call for years and now I have it. I urge any of you with a similar toxic relationship with alcohol to try and intervene before things get to this stage, or to seek help! If you are reading this it is absolutely not too late to change. Fuck what anybody thinks of your decision. Most of all do it for yourself, those closest to you will also benefit! My injury could have been much worse, brain damage could have occured (if it hasn't anyway and I don't yet know) I could ultimately be dead in the worst case scenario, and the thought of putting my family through that is enough to make me finally stop drinking for good. Had things panned out slightly differently I wouldn't be writing this post right now. In my eyes I am a very lucky man with one last chance to do the right thing, to stop robbing myself of happiness and a live a life independent of the binge drinking hell I've been living through during the last 10 years. Good luck to everyone and thank you for allowing me to share this story!!"

My girlfriend messaged me saying she¡¯s been drinking. They¡¯ve been sober since before we met and seems to be in quite a self hating place. They doesn¡¯t want me to go to theirs, because of past trauma of people around them when they¡¯re drunk, and has refused a phone call I think out of embarrassment but they are speaking to me via text.

alcoholism,SarahSav4ge,2020/1/20,"Asking for help and support: it's getting worse with my loved one Attention: English is not my main Languange, so please be gentle.  
My loved on has te courage to finally go to a clinical treatment. I'm really, really proud of her, but at the same time out of sudden everything seems to get even worse. I'm writing this post because I just wanted a place to share my story, but I'd also hope people can give me advice.   


Since the treatment is coming more in sight, she started to drink even more. Also she started to get violent towards me on every single level: sexually, verbally and physically. When things got physical, I immediately called the police and since that very moment, she isn't welcome in my house anymore: I'm not save around her.   


I don't even recognise her anymore and sometimes she even seems so confused, I wonder if she's psychotic due to all the alcohol. I'm not a specialist, so I don't know anything about it, but the things she said to me are so strange. For example: she screamed I am not save and people want to harm me. Also she thinks she's going to die.   


I'm so worried and at the same time I also feel anger towards her, because of those aggressive outbursts."

Over the last 2 years now, my girlfriend has been drinking in secret. It was more apparent at certain times, and may not have even been everyday of the week, but it was enough to draw some real concern from me. We got into this fucking terrible cycle of me noticing her acting different, accusing her of drinking, her denying it, me finding the alcohol, fighting, and then repeating the same scenario about every 4-8 weeks. I¡¯ve become a detective that specializes in alcohol, and I hate it. I hate feeling like I¡¯m invading her privacy, finding the alcohol, and above all, being blamed for her having to hide her drinking. 

She would tell me things like ¡°if I wasn¡¯t so judgmental, that she wouldn¡¯t have to hide it¡± and plenty of other things along those lines. Never did she come to me and admit her secret drinking was unhealthy and abnormal - until yesterday. 

She broke down, confided some things in me about how she¡¯s been feeling and some past trauma she dealt with, and finally said, ¡°I know my drinking isn¡¯t normal, I was scared to acknowledge it bc then I would know I had a problem¡±. She then asked me for help. 

I feel like this is a huge step, and it took a ton for her to say that. I need advice on where to go from here though. I obviously can¡¯t do it all. How do I help her? I really need some advice besides ¡°go to AA¡±

Or should you just stay quiet and pretend everything is fine, so they never know there's an issue? Especially considering they might not remember having done anything.

In my case, I was never confronted, and found out how people felt through another source. As a result, gossip and false rumors spread, and some friends cut me off without even talking to me. If I had been confronted about it, I would have taken responsibility and cut down on drinking sooner. But now, it just feels like I had a bunch of fake friends who were too afraid of confrontation to say anything...

alcoholism,fouton-friend,2020/1/20,"I have been asked to assist a family member with their detox, what can I do to provide a good space for them? I recently had a family member reach out to me about crashing at my apartment while they try and sober up. It is something that I am incredibly happy to do for them, but it is also an area that I am completely unfamiliar with. He reached out to me because he would rather not go through it while living at home with his parents, and having known them for years I would agree that this might be for the best. 

Some background:

I'm currently in graduate school, so I will be in and out of my place quite often. I hardly drink, and I quit any and all drug use a couple of years ago, so maintaining a ""substance"" free apartment won't be difficult at all. I've got a pretty comfortable futon (which I'm just now realizing I misspelled in my throwaway) for him to crash on.

alcoholism,Pumpkin1390_,2020/3/16,"[SERIOUS] Seeking resources in DFW Texas. Hello lovely people. I have never been on this subreddit before so please let me know if I have broken any rules. 


I have a family friend who I¡¯ve known for a couple years now. He is in his mid twenties, has alcohol related seizures multiple times a week, and is basically a dead man walking. I know there¡¯s nothing I can do to help him as he needs to help himself as is extremely resistant to opening up and being honest about his feelings and struggles. All his ¡°friends¡± and even some of his family members enable his alcoholism even though he likely has irreversible brain damage, and at the rate he¡¯s going, will die within the next couple of years, if not much sooner. Basically everyone talks about his issues and how they feel helpless behind his back but no one will actually confront him with his own reality. What little friends he has maintained, want to help him but are just shut out. I know this is pretty common with those struggling with addiction and mental health. 

It¡¯s a vicious cycle. 

I just want to get a packet together of available resources for him because that¡¯s honestly all anyone else can do for him at this point. He went to rehab about five hours from here, where his dad lives, then stayed with him instead of living in a half way house. However the moment he moved back home, he immediately relapsed. He has been to MHMR (country services) and should be following their crisis program. However, the only reason he is following their program is because a Mental Health Deputy will be knocking on his door if he doesn¡¯t appear for his counseling, case worker, or psych appointments. I¡¯m looking for groups, medical facilities, and any form of assistance where a team of people can teach him the skills he needs to figure this out. It¡¯s really quite dire at these point.

Thank you so much in advance. I wish all you lovely people joy, healing, and strength. You all are doing such great things to improve your health and spirit. I wish for each and every one of you that you reach the light at the end of the tunnel."
alcoholism,wandringstar,2020/1/7,"Anhedonia, Masochism, &amp; Philip K Dick Hello, everyone! Just as a note, I already posted this to r/stopdrinking and I¡¯ll likely be posting something similar to the AA Reddit as well. I would crosspost but it doesn¡¯t seem that is allowed in these subs (understandably.)

Yesterday I read this passage from VALIS by Philip K. Dick and it seemed very interesting to me. This morning I went to an AA meeting and I realized why: the experience of anhedonia/disillusionment (nothing is fun or meaningful or happy) that I have been feeling is very real. Not only because I¡¯ve been numbing myself with alcohol, but because I¡¯ve been actively destroying myself to feel a sense of control. Giving myself an excuse not to try. I could easily drink myself to death in the struggle to escape my own feelings of existential dread and helplessness. From small things like not being able to control alcoholism (so I binge drink and make the question irrelevant) to less tangible things like struggling to cope with my mortality or feelings of impotence.

Even sometimes the disease itself can be a crutch, something for us to focus on. I don¡¯t really have a relationship with a ¡°higher power¡± yet (I¡¯m only a week sober...hopefully it will come) but I really feel like this seems to hit the nail on the head re: admitting we are powerless. 

Anyway, I thought you might enjoy. I apologize in advance for the wall of text; I transcribed it as it is written (no paragraph breaks.)

¡°In his study of the form that masochism takes in modern man, Theodor Reik puts forth an interesting view. Masochism is more widespread than we realize because it takes an attenuated form. The basic dynamism is as follows: a human being sees something bad which is coming as inevitable. There is no way he can halt the process; he is helpless. This sense of helplessness generates a need to gain some control over the impending pain¡ªany kind of control will do. This makes sense; the subjective feeling of helplessness is more painful than the impending misery. So the person seizes control over the situation in the only way open to him: he connives to bring on the impending misery; he hastens it. This activity on his part promotes the false impression that he enjoys pain. Not so. It is simply that he cannot any longer endure the helplessness or the supposed helplessness. But in the process of gaining control over the inevitable misery he becomes, automatically, anhedonic (which means being unable or unwilling to enjoy pleasure). Anhedonia sets in stealthily. Over the years it takes control of him. For example, he learns to defer gratification; this is a step in the dismal process of anhedonia. In learning to defer gratification he experiences a sense of self-mastery; he has become stoic, disciplined; he does not give way to impulse. He has *control*. Control over himself in terms of his impulses and control over the external situation. He is a controlled and controlling person. Pretty soon he has branched out and is controlling other people, as part of the situation. He becomes a manipulator. Of course, he is not consciously aware of this; all he intends to do is lessen his own sense of impotence. But in his task of lessening this sense, he insidiously overpowers the freedom of others. Yet, he derives no pleasure from this, no positive psychological gain; all his gains are essentially negative.

¡°In summary [...] the modern-day masochist does not enjoy pain, he simply can¡¯t stand being helpless.¡±

alcoholism,Left-Extent,2020/3/26,"My Mom needs help and I don't know what to do. My Mom and I have always had a rocky relationship. My Mom neglected me from the day I was born and I have trauma from the neglect that I don't think will ever completely be healed, because it's developmental. 

When I got into my teens, I dealt with severe depression and anxiety and the only way I could connect with my Mom was when she would drink and party with me. I had to watch my Mom go in and out of mental institutions and rehabs - sometimes even having to live in them with her - throughout my entire childhood.  

I won't keep going through the past, but eventually I ended up hating her for many years and stopped talking to her for 3 after having my own children and moving to another state. The more I started to learn about trauma, I started to have a sense of compassion for my Mom and when she contacted me and told me she was sorry, we started talking again. 

My Mom is what they call a ""functional alcoholic"". My Mom drinks herself stupid when she knows she doesn't have to be to places like work or social gatherings where she has to make a good impression. She's done it for a long time and seems to think she has it under control, but theres some weeks she would completely lose it and call me crying saying how much she wants to die and how she's tired of drinking. 

So with the coronavirus forcing her to work out of home instead of her office, I was worried from the beginning that it would cause her to drink herself into a hole of misery and it has. She is about to lose her job because she hasn't worked in over 4 days. She says she just drinks and goes to bed. 

I've struggled with addiction myself, but alcohol is an entirely different demon I've never personally had to battle with outside of having to battle my Mom. 

When I moved back to my home city, I thought my Mom was doing a lot better, but I learned she's just gotten better at masking it and the closer I got the more I realized nothing had really changed as far as her alcoholism. As much as she's hurt me, my Mom has a lot of great qualities and I still love her and want her to be happy. She currently has a new girlfriend who isn't helping her and all she does is drink with her. My Mom even said just now when I called her that ""she's no good for me"". She was drunk and crying, and hung up. 

I want her to get help and be around for her Grandkids, and I tell her that, but I don't know how to best support her that would encourage her to get help. She gone through so many rehabs and she's 53 years old¨C when is enough going to be enough?"
alcoholism,ok_byside,2020/1/27,"Sleepwalking, or as I like to call it, drunkwalking So this one¡¯s a bit personal, but I¡¯m sure most of us have been there at one point or another. 
I¡¯m wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences before. 

Something used to happen when I drank a lot and I¡¯ve never known if this is common thing or not.

A few years ago I was going through a pretty bad rough patch, won¡¯t go into the details but it was some messed up stuff. 
On the nights that I was emotionally distraught, I would drink my normal amount (not actually that much since during that time my tolerance was still building) and eventually would go to bed. 


It was completely different than blacking out.
I remember going to bed, I would usually remember going to sleep too, but ONLY on those nights, I would get back up at some point during the night and I guess sleepwalk. 
When I woke up in the morning I would find that things were knocked over, and almost always a suspicious wet spot on the floor....or in my bed.

I soon realized I had been either urinating on the floor or wetting the bed, and on one occasion, my sister heard me ¡°ricocheting¡± down the hall, found me laying on the stairs, tried to wake me up, and just went back to bed after giving up.

Another time I burst into my mother¡¯s room ¡°flailing like a fish¡± and just...didn¡¯t know how to get back out. 

I don¡¯t remember these things, and I always woke up in my bed like normal. I¡¯d also gotten significantly more drunk on different nights and had nothing of this sort happen at all.

The reason why I¡¯m so curious is because it has recently been brought to my attention that I have some neurological problems that have apparently been there since my childhood, specifically possible (most likely) seizures.
So a lot of experiences from my past have come to light as being definitely not normal. 
For example blacking out, drug like sensations....

I think that once the person decides to make such a polar change to their lifestyle some of those around them dont know how to take it almost, or seeing someone make such a change makes them look at their own faults and they dont like that. Alot of people cannot understand what it was like to live in addiction. I've had people treat me like I'm a piece of shit, and act like they are better than me bc they didn't go thru what I did.

alcoholism,Shoowopp,2020/1/16,"How do I continue to hold on to a reason to stay sober? 5 days from now I will have been completely free of alcohol for 11 months. Prior to my sobriety, I drank until I blacked out every night for just around 4 years  

Last February I spent 1.5 months in the ICU with life-threatening pancreatitis, severe liver and stomach damage, and a long list of other health problems directly caused by years of alcohol abuse. I have yet to fully recover and likely never will. This was a serious turning point in my life and I have been able to successfully stay sober, although, I will add, it has been incredibly difficult. 

As I near 11 months and soon a full year of sobriety, I am ashamed to say that I have found myself thinking more often about drinking again. The doctors and surgeons who essentially brought me back to life all warned me that if I ever drink again I would almost certainly die. Even though I know this information, I can't help but think more and more about drinking.

I want to believe that I am strong enough to abstain from drinking, but as the 11 and 12 month anniversary of my sobriety approach I feel immense shame and I've been beating myself up over it. 

Is it common to feel like complete shit around anniversaries? I don't know how to talk about this with others. I hid my drinking from everyone around me, and I've continued to hide my past as well as my struggles with sobriety. If anybody has tips on sobriety in the long term, I would greatly appreciate it.

alcoholism,aynon22,2020/3/4,"Looking for advice about my brother. Hi reddit, longtime lurker here needing some help for my older brother.
I am the youngest of 3. I have two older brothers. My oldest brother is super successful and lives across the country, we (my other brother, mom, and dad) don¡¯t see him much besides on holidays. My middle brother (we will call him Sam) is struggling with alcohol addiction and is stuck in a depressive cycle because of it. It has cost him several jobs, relationships, and he has two aggravated DUIs. My family is at our breaking point dealing with him and his reluctance to address his problem.

Sam and I moved in together in 2015 after his seven-year relationship ended because of his drinking. I agreed to move in with Sam because my lease was ending and i was trying to do what i could to help my brother and my family. While we lived together I did my best to try to keep him sober but quickly learned that I was not able to do that no matter how much love and support I offered him. Unfortunately I became the middle-person between my mom and Sam - my mom would frequently reach out to me asking about the status of my brother and if he is sober. My mom and i are extremely close and talk everyday, and soon nearly all of our conversations became about Sam. i would alert her when Sam was not doing well and my mom and/or my dad would come over to our place and try to convince him to go to their house so they could keep an eye on him and prevent him from drinking. Looking back i see how severely dysfunctional and enabling this is, but we were honestly doing it out of pure concern for him and the desire to ¡°save¡± him. We had several huge family fights at me and Sam¡¯s place, but Sam would eventually come around and thank me and my parents for trying to help him. 
Sam and I moved out in September 2019 - I moved in with my boyfriend and Sam moved in with a friend who has previously struggled with alcohol but is now sober. Ever since then Sam has been really out of control. He had the interlock taken off his car (he was mandated one after his DUIs but my family convinced him to put one back on after he was driving drunk). He lost his job due to drinking at work, got hired at a new job and lost it in the same week because he no-called-no-showed while he holed up in a motel and drank for two days straight. He went to inpatient rehab (for the second time) for 30 days and drank the day he got out. 

There are so many other things I could write about, but the reason for this post is to ask how to break the cycle of myself and my parents coming to Sam¡¯s rescue. My mom always rescues Sam when he is spiraling out of control because she loves him and would do anything for him (and clearly has). It is so unfair to her. My mom has had multiple health problems over the years and is not in the greatest of health, and bringing on Sam¡¯s problems certainly isn¡¯t helping. She is exhausted and exasperated and at her wits end as she¡¯s done everything in her power to help but nothing works. My Dad tries to be supportive but is clearly fed up and wants nothing to do with Sam anymore. My Dad and Sam are starting to physically fight when Sam is drunk.

The most infuriating part of all of this is that Sam refuses to seek help. He has agreed to inpatient rehab but admits that he just goes through the motions so he can get out and drink. He has tried therapy a couple times but again, it seems like he doesn¡¯t truly open himself up and eventually stops going and claims it doesn¡¯t work. He says there is nothing he can do to stop, he¡¯s tried everything and nothing works. My heart breaks for my brother, but even more so for my parents. He is currently living at my parents house. 

Tl;dr: my brother is an alcoholic, my family and I are in a cycle of rescuing him and enabling him and we can¡¯t stop"

alcoholism,stigstig76,2020/2/16,"An interesting turn of events I just wanted to post this because I think it's going to be interesting for some. I'll also give the following disclaimer: I am not endorsing consuming alcohol to anyone.
My back story is similar to many; lots of alcohol missuse; bouts of depression; punctuated with months of abstinence here and there. 
So, I'm a teacher and my school has arranged for very expensive life coaching/ therapy sessions where everything is open for discussion. The guy with whom I spoke was just amazing and the conversation inevitably came around to my drinking problem. Instead of addressing the alcohol directly, he took me back to the roots of my problems - being bullied as a child; staying in toxic relationships far too long to name just two examples. By using EFT (google it - it's been a game changer for me) it became possible to separate my problem drinking from the root causes. My drinking has been a symptom, not the cause of my problems - it has massively exacerbated my problems- but it's never been the root cause. So anyway, I've spent the last six months hiding away and living a super restrictive life but last night I met up with a friend and had a few beers. Today, where I would have usually binge drunk myself into oblivion for a few months before getting sober again, I feel totally 'normal'. I don't want to drink. I know I don't have to drink. Drink doesn't feel important anymore. Who knows when and if I drink again. It feels totally different, like i can just live my life without constantly thinking and reading about alcohol. For context I'm 43 and have been dealing with the booze for many years.
Again, I am NOT advising anyone to start drinking, I just would urge anyone to try and address the root causes that may have led to their alcohol misuse. Much love"

He doesn¡¯t get super drunk every night (at least not for the past year or so) but he¡¯s developed pretty severe panic/anxiety disorder which I¡¯m 99% sure is related to short term effects from drinking. It¡¯s a pretty often scenario for him to wake up in the middle of the night and come down to my room having anxiety for me to calm him down and try to decide if we go to the ER. On the worst night we do go to the ER, his BP is staggering (like stroke level), and he experiences extreme chest pains. 

I was feeling better about the situation recently as he agreed to taper his drinking and the decrease in anxiety was readily apparent, I felt like I had my dad back for the first time in years and could clearly communicate with him. A few weeks ago however I had to go on an emergency trip to help my girlfriend move and in the time I was gone he¡¯s fallen into old habits.

Because of the many sleepless nights worried about him, the countless times he¡¯s withdrawn or become angry with me for no reason, the hospital trips, etc. I think I¡¯m a little traumatized by it all and now every time I see him having a drink it really messes up my mood and often my day never really comes back from the moment I see him drinking in excess of his taper goals.

I also can¡¯t help but pay attention to how much he¡¯s drinking as in my mind each drink increases the likelihood I will need to take him to the hospital between 2-6 AM (when the booze wears off and most anxiety attacks occur). At this point I¡¯m not really sleeping unless I basically pass out from exhaustion which usually happens around 8 AM or so. I¡¯ve tried to explain what¡¯s going on but he responds with anger.

alcoholism,Lather,2020/2/26,"Moderation rather than quitting? I know in the AA circle this is a super taboo subject, but has anyone tried and succeeded in moderating rather than abstinence?

I'm not asking this because I WANT to carry on drinking, but I've spent several years being told total abstinence is the only way if you're an alcoholic. This has lead to me abstaining maybe for a week, sometimes two weeks then inevitably caving in and drinking. With that drink comes intense guilt because I've 'ruined' my sobriety, and what do I do to handle that guilt? Of course I start drinking again. It's been an endless cycle for the past 5 years.

For the first time I decided to seek outside help for my alcoholism! I met with a really lovely (and eccentric) doctor today who explained that for some people, moderation can be better rather than totally quitting. I explained my situation and he said, this time, don't tell yourself you can never drink again. Say 'I will only drink once every two weeks'. If I can manage that, then great, if I can't then we can work on abstinence. 

Just wondering if anyone else who has been an alcoholic for several years had any luck with moderation? 

Side question: Is there a discord for alcoholics that isn't AA based? The one I'm in is very helpful but they also seem very close minded on a lot of things."

Police were called and after some convincing, they agreed to do a welfare check. He was found in bed and had been dead for a couple of days.

alcoholism,DaeSh1m,2020/3/31,"Why do you drink to sickness? Hi all. I'm not an alcoholic; I maybe drink a beer or two every 2-4 weeks. My uncle was a severe alcoholic and eventually passed away from excessive drinking at a relatively young age (60).   


Anytime I've had enough drinks to feel that sort of nausea or headache or uneasy feeling, I immediately wonder how this is something anyone would enjoy doing enough to actually get addicted to it. Recently, I watched an episode of Intervention and saw an alcoholic who was pounding liters of vodka daily and was just rolling around, groaning, throwing up, drooling, and passing out. I understand addiction to speedy things...In fact, I quite like taking amphetamine, methylphenidate etc...it feels great, you don't feel sick...you feel alert, confident, talkative, cool, cocky, smart. But, alcohol basically feels like poisoning yourself.

I?ve been noticing for the last 3-4 years, that my dad drinks too much and I?m really starting to get worried with him.

I?m only 17 years old , and it?s very hard for me to cope with this situation because it happens way too often. He is not the kind of person that drinks every day till he passes out, but it seems like nowadays everything is an excuse to drink , for example , every time we go to a restaurant he has to drink a entire bootle of wine and sometimes even more and this leads to very unconfortable moments , every time he goes out on the weekend with his friends he shows at home wasted.

At least once a week (work days) he shows at home a little tipsy and then he drinks again at dinner.

I think my dad can be considered as a functional alchoolic , he never had any trouble at work (at least that im aware of), but he frequently drives above the legal limit and I have no idea how to talk with him about this situation, I mean it shouldn?t even be my job, but my mum avoids this topic and he is not a very open person, which makes things even harder."

alcoholism,PM_YOUR_SIDEBOOB,2020/1/21,"Am I going through withdrawal? Hi everyone

I recently started the Keto diet and, although not necessary, decided to go the extra mile and completely cut out drinking. Partly because most alcoholic drinks are ripe with carbs, but also because I feel it's been an unspoken problem in my life for too long.
My alcohol use has been a sliding scale but I would say for the last few months my average week included one or two days of heavy drinking, 3 or 4 days of drinking a couple to sleep, and maybe once a week where I didn't drink at all.

I started keto two weeks ago and haven't had a drop of alcohol the whole time. I deal with pretty crippling anxiety and depression on a regular basis but this last week has been ABSOLUTE HELL. This is the worst I've ever felt mentally.
The reason I'm not sure if it's withdrawal is because 1) every website and every person says days 7-10 are the worst and it gets better, but I'm sitting on day 15 wanting to die. 2) I'm not really experiencing the other general signs. I'm a tad shakey, but I always am. I'm a bit more irritable than usual, but that's probably a direct result of increased anxiety. Beyond that, I've exhibited absolutely no physical signs of alcohol withdrawal.
It could be the diet, it could be the immediate decrease in alcohol. It could be a million other things or none at all. Sometimes mental illnesses just get worse for no reason. 
I guess I'm just hoping someone has an answer because experiencing this is just making me want to go back to drinking even more."

In the past, I would become angry and disappointed due to some of the things he¡¯s done and said while drinking. I also would have little patience as I felt like I had to treat him like a child in order to take care of him while he¡¯s drunk. 

My whole life, I¡¯ve never been raised around good role models for drinking responsibly. I¡¯ve had old friends in high school who are now alcoholics. The town I was raised in had a huge problem with drunk drivers killing high schoolers and other people at least a few times a month. So I¡¯ve never had a proper example of what drinking responsibly is like nor have I been taught how to talk to someone about their drinking problem. 

Now, presently, my partner has corrected their drinking problem (kind of). But last night, we were at one of their friends houses drinking, and my partner had way too many beers. My partner ended up being overwhelming, and I was tired as hell and just wanted to sleep. I tried my best to be patient, but my patience wore thin.

alcoholism,nickkkkk77,2020/4/20,"My (alcoholic) experience beating coronavirus Hey there everyone, I¡¯m making this post so people can get an idea of what it¡¯s like to contract coronavirus while battling alcoholism. *Should throw out a disclaimer that I think my recovery could have been a lot smoother if I wasn¡¯t drinking so I definitely recommend abstinence if possible

I have had an alcohol use disorder for about 3 years now (21). I am in good health which may have strongly  assisted in my recovery. I hope everyone practices social distancing unlike I did, as it is the best way to preserve good health. 

The following is a day by day description of the symptom progression- 

Day 1- had gone out drinking with some friends the night before the symptoms first manifested and I was developing what can only be described as a very irritated sensation in my lungs, as if my lungs were  smouldering coals every time I inhaled. It was cool outside and the cold air exacerbated this feeling, so I assumed it was probably the copious amounts of cigarettes I had indulged in the previous night. 

Day 2- the burning sensation worsened throughout the day but I finally accepted that I was most likely developing the early symptoms of what I thought was probably a cold. Started to cough a lot

Day 3- finally started feeling under the weather, the irritated sensation in my lungs was driving my dry cough that only seemed to get worse. Felt fatigued all day and towards the end of the night I started developing a mild fever. 

Day 4- I woke up in the morning, rendered immobile from body aches, and a record high fever that left me shivering so hard it could have been mistaken as a seizure even under three blankets. I was so fatigued I couldn¡¯t even stand, and it only worsened as the night progressed. I had absolutely no appetite and didn¡¯t have anything to eat all day, as I felt as though even one bite would provoke a vomit attack. I developed a very high heart rate that averaged 130 bpm that turned irregular if I exerted too much effort. I think the scariest thing I experienced throughout the whole ordeal happened that night as my lungs felt so heavy I couldn¡¯t take even half a breath and I was left panting heavily in a prostrate position. I started to panic and consider going to the hospital. 

Day 5- much of the same symptoms from day 3 persisted throughout this day, however towards nighttime I started to drift off into a dreamlike state of disorientation. I can only describe it as hallucinations. I would start to hear voices and see myself in other places only to jerk back into reality in a completely different place than I thought I was. I couldn¡¯t even walk myself to the bathroom because I couldn¡¯t muster enough energy to roll over let alone stand up. I had to have my dad carry me to the washroom and back. 

Day-6 I felt significantly better on the sixth day, I was able to eat small meals and walk around however I still had a severe cough and mild shortness of breath

Day-7 all the symptoms I had started to diminish and I took the whole day to just rest and recuperate from the remaining lethargy and malaise

By day 8 i felt good enough to go out and buy 12 beers which I finished off to celebrate my recovered health 

I maintained a dry cough for about 4-5 days after all the other symptoms disappeared but I have since 100% recovered and feel good as new. 

I just wanted to reassure anyone who might be having a lot of anxiety about Covid-19, that it isn¡¯t a death sentence (although it sure was shitty)"

I really can¡¯t blame her; I¡¯ve not kept my word about it many times over the past couple of years but have been on a good program since November. The past few times I¡¯ve slipped, I¡¯ve been able to stay positive and focused, forgive myself, and move on with a new understanding of my sobriety the next day. 

This time though, it feels like while Im able to forgive myself, it seems like she¡¯s struggling to forgive me. The past relapses, she¡¯s had the same attitude as me; ¡°ok it happened. Learn from it and move forward.¡±  This was incredibly helpful. Her reaction this time is killing me and putting me in a very dark anxious place that I used to block out by drinking. Not her fault, but I¡¯m struggling to move forward with a positive attitude this time around.

alcoholism,justalotofcats,2020/2/15,"Ideas for helping recovering friend Hi everyone, my best friend is currently at a rehab facility that doesn¡¯t allow electronics (this is not his first rodeo, but the first without electronics), and unfortunately we are now 5.5 hours away, I always work on the days designated as ¡°family days,¡± and I work evenings/nights, so the times that he can call me, I usually can¡¯t answer :(. I will end up visiting him, but it¡¯s been so hard to make it work, and obviously it can¡¯t be a weekly thing. He says he understands, but it still makes me sad because I feel I¡¯m not being as supportive as I want to be this time around because I haven¡¯t really been able to see/communicate with him aside from letters we¡¯ve been sending back and forth by mail. This last relapse was also pretty bad so I want to be there as much as I can even if I can¡¯t *be* there.

I was thinking to surprise him with a nice book, but I don¡¯t know if I should pick something that¡¯s similar to his current situation/what he¡¯s been through/going through. If I went that route, I was thinking to send The Lost Weekend by Charles Jackson, however, I have never experienced addiction myself, and he¡¯s mentioned that at rehab they¡¯ve watched ¡°triggering¡± movies recently, and I don¡¯t want to end up making it hard for him by triggering him. I also don¡¯t know if self-help books would help/be interesting¡ªhe¡¯s doing stuff all day in the ¡°self-help¡± category, so I wonder, is that really a good gift to give?

Alternately, I could send him random books that I like that I think he will too, but I can¡¯t think of anything with that overall *hopeful* theme I¡¯m going for at the moment.

alcoholism,grass_isgreener,2020/4/19,"How to help an alcoholic in denial with memory problems?  

For a few years my sister (23) has suspected that my mom (62) might have developed a drinking problem. Until about a year ago I (23) didn¡¯t necessarily think she was right, but then began to notice some worrisome behavior. Before I go into the details about what¡¯s happened, I think it¡¯s also important to note my mom has a memory impairment- it's probably early onset Alzheimer¡¯s that hasn¡¯t been diagnosed, but from an MRI looks very likely. 

About a year ago I would notice sometimes we talked on the phone in the early or late evening she would be slurring her words, and she would be a little more forgetful than normal. I don¡¯t live in the same state and try to see her every few months, but because of this I couldn¡¯t really observe her behavior. 

Last June I visited her to take her to see a neurologist, and I ended up taking her to the emergency room. She had gone on a date, got drunk and wandered out of the restaurant before dinner had been served, and a group of very sweet teenagers called me from her phone, saying she had fallen and hit her head on the sidewalk. Once things calmed down I called her date to try to figure out what happened, and he said she had about 6 glasses of wine and then disappeared. When I picked her up she had claimed to only have 2 glasses, but was very inebriated. At that time I was concerned, but thought with her memory condition she had forgotten how many glasses she had. 

About a month ago I got a call from her around 11:30 am on a Saturday- she was slurring her words and not making much sense- she kept calling me her dog¡¯s name. I called her boyfriend, who she¡¯s been dating for about 9 months, to see if he could go check on her. It turns out she hadn¡¯t eaten enough and had likely also mixed up medications on top of drinking. He took her out to eat, and again she wandered out of the restaurant. This time he had to call the police to find her. 

With the coronavirus he has been living with her, and today he realized she was sneaking around and had likely been drinking vodka and wine without him knowing and fell and hurt her wrist. When he suggested that maybe they shouldn¡¯t keep alcohol in the house she got mad and told him to leave. She did forget that she said that so he is still with her, but I am concerned because this is such a huge burden for him. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do? I am in the middle of moving and we are also in the middle of a pandemic so I don¡¯t know if I should go down to visit or not, and even if I go I don¡¯t know what to do. Any suggestions would be wonderful."

For the past few years, on an infrequent basis, i've been having insane night terrors, that seems to be the only thing it could be. People around me hear me banging on things, screaming, etc, while asleep. I'm completely unaware of it and not in control of it at all. 

I drink a LOT. Probably close to a liter of liquor per evening on a long night. 

I had severe sleeping issues prior to starting to drink, which is why I started in the first place, but I never did anything crazy in my sleep, which kind of leaves the booze as the primary suspect here. 

Anyone else ever experience anything like this? 

Also, I just got my first order of Naltrexone from a sketchy Indian pharmacy, which i'm excited about, but also a bit nervous. If I don't drink, or drink significantly less than normal, I have crazy muscle spasms, insane dreams, fairly typical withdrawl/DT type symptoms. 

If the Naltrexone works and gets me drinking way less, am I in danger of major seizures? I've got a limited amount of anti-spasm medication, which works on the days when I have the issues, but not enough for if it were to start being an everyday thing, and no easy route to get more.

According to her he never drank for fun or had drinking binges ever ) 

He has a new partner since who loves him and tries to keep him away from alcohol. Well anyways, since I was around 7 he would get drunk for a few days in a row, not do anything but just sleep and drink/watch TV and he'd snap out of it. Many holidays were spent with him drunk for a week straight. 

Over the years it got worse where hed be drunk 2-3 weeks straight with a few months between Everytime and two of those binges over the past 3 years landed him in the hospital from alcohol withdrawal. Last binge was 1.5 years ago which was the 2nd hospitalization and he's been sober since.

I dont drink alone, I'm happy to go without, I never struggle with a pressing need to drink, and from what ive seen theres no ways in which my drinking has negatively affected me or my loved ones.

Even though i don't really feel like living in a dream anymore, i still have a lot of difficulty with sleeping.

I get panic attacks when i'm sober and trying to sleep and i just get stressed about the thought of not being able to sleep, which makes me not able to sleep. I'm going to see a psychologist in a few days and i'm trying to reduce the amount of alcohol that i consume every day (i drink every day).

But the last year in school, living off campus in a student housing place, I  had a few weeks where I was drinking some, for the first time in my life ( was probably 23 at the time). I started to drink screwdrivers.

One weekend, my roommates had some friends over a Friday night, and I was having screwdrivers. I of course ended up drinking too much, and partially blacked out during the night. I spent part of the night keeled over the kitchen sink puking. I eventually puked on the kitchen floor. At maybe 3-4am, my roommate (Filipino guy ex-marine and college student) came to check on me, and slipped in the puke on the kitchen floor. He insisted on asking me, making me explain why I made him step/slip in my puke, even though I was wasted out of my mind and barely knew what he was asking (I only really remembered this later). 

I then woke up in the living room at 10am, still drunk, and went to my room. I spent the next 36 hours in my bed, wondering if I was going to die. I threw up 5 times that Saturday after I woke up (my resting heart rate was 110-120bpm), and was stuck in bed in a fetal position, until around 10-11pm Sunday night, before I finally started to feel somewhat okay. 

The ironic part is, I then went years again between drinks, but then when I finally started to drink again, at 28 years old, I actually became an heavy drinker.

- overlaid with all of this has been him lying to me and gaslighting me about his drinking for two extended periods. He tells me he isn¡¯t drinking, or is drinking far less than he actually is, even when I ask him to his face, and once lied to me for a whole year straight
- He does go through periods of not drinking at all, but there¡¯s always eventually a reason after a few months or less that he needs to just have a few
- i caught him drunk on the sofa in the middle of the night a couple of nights ago. I thought he was having a glass or three of wine in the evening (I wasn¡¯t thrilled with this, but it was an improvement). Turns out he¡¯s also been buying 40s of cheap beer and also drinking 1-3 of those every night. This is why he hasn¡¯t slept in the bed with me for months. 
- once I caught him, he confessed, but I still don¡¯t know what to believe. He did confess to drinking in the morning for the first time recently, and said that scared him
- he of course appeared very remorseful and ashamed at being caught and at lying to me and about the drinking
- when I caught him after the year of lying about drinking a few years ago, I told him I knew he would mess up and make mistakes, and that the only thing I needed from him was honesty. I didn¡¯t tell him he had to stop drinking, I just wanted honesty. It took a long time for me to think I could trust him again. Now after this second extended period of lying, it¡¯s clear I cannot trust him about alcohol and he is indeed a functional alcoholic.
- he¡¯s been out of work for almost a year, for unrelated reasons (as far as I know) so him sleeping it off isn¡¯t affecting his work, and he is actively looking for work and has some prospects
- he hasn¡¯t had any bad behavior in front of our kids, and that seems to be a boundary he really wants to stick to because his own father was an alcoholic

Okay, SO. Here are my questions:
1. He says the only way he will get through this is if I am not angry at him but supportive instead. I initially agreed, but I AM angry, I¡¯m just not showing it. Am I actually enabling him by not expressing my anger? Will me being angry actually make him want to drink more and then make this all harder?

2. What kind of boundaries are reasonable for me to set? We got rid of the alcohol in the house (I hope). Is it reasonable to tell him he can¡¯t drink around me, and there can be no alcohol in our house? I¡¯m abstaining to try to make it easier on him.

3. Does AA actually work? If so, is there a way for him to attend meetings online during the pandemic? We can¡¯t afford therapy right now and I don¡¯t know what else to do.

In almost every other respect he is the perfect partner, and we have two amazing children together. I will not be walking away from this relationship without a fight. I just don¡¯t know what direction to move in, and I don¡¯t know how to help him and help myself."

I wish I listened to myself before this virus. This is hard to admit, but yes, I am an alcoholic. I'm not going to go into my full history, but long story short, my new year's resolution was to quit drinking at home alone. I have anxiety and depression issues that I will be talking to my therapist about, though I can't afford more than every 2 weeks. I have daddy issues, which I think are the root of my mental health problems.

The reason I am writing now, is that despite my acknowledgement of my problems, I cannot shrug off this need for alcohol. I've been at home for 4 days now, yet I've binged on alcohol twice. I do my yoga, coffee, exercise routines for a few hours, but after 3-4 I am lost on how to keep myself busy. I cook, but only once or twice a week, and last time I cooked while drunk.

It's hard enough to be sober during this pandemic, being an alcoholic is so fucking hard for me. I need help thinking of ways I can keep myself sober, I don't know what to do.

I have been drinking for a long period of time now. About 4 years of heavy consumption, strictly at night in order to help my sleep.

After which, I have consistently been getting anxiety.

Now during this i have kept my drinking habits the same. Havent quit, i know probably bad for my anxiety attacks.

Upon looking up the symptoms of DTs i found them to be very similar to my panic and anxiety disorders:


-Feeling of dread and death

-Intense shaking (legs and arms)

-Doubting whether or not what i heard was actually there

-Panic that is unable to shake and without clear causation.

-Dissocation

-Weird sensation of instant panic when attempting to fall back asleep

-unable to consistently eat 


Now when i rationalize eveything, it doesnt make sense that it would be DT's. I have not quit drinking and i have a relatively coherent stream of thought. 
Also, the intense
However, the shaking and dissociation, coupled with the uncertainty of noises around me has me on edge. My worry is that somehow my body is not metabolizing the alcohol in the way it had previously

To give some context I'm 24F and have always known my father to be an aggressive alcoholic.  I was lucky to enough to have a mum that took me out of that situation when I was six and they got a divorce. I sadly at that age did witness them fighting regularly with one night resulting in my mum getting beaten up so badly that her face became unrecognisible and bizarrely my six year old mind used to blame myself for what was happening. Not long after the divorce my father got remarried and as my mum still wanted me to have a father figure in my life, I would occasionally visit them. My father's aggression would fluctuate depending on the day but his alcohol intake was always consistent. During those years I have witnessed a lot of things that I have only this summer been able to leave in the past with therapy.   
However this post isn't about my father, it's about my mum.   
She has always liked the occasional beer after work but it has now turned into 4-5 a night with the occasional sober day in between so nowhere near as much as my father (I don't know what else to compare it to) but definitely more than 'normal'?   
I've tried talking to her, she hasn't taken me seriously but eventually accepted that maybe she does drink too much and it's mainly because of boredom. She doesn't become aggressive, she becomes happier. So it's really difficult to distinguish if this is an actual problem.   
We spoke about the quantity of her drinking and she agreed that she needed to cut down but didn't and has continued to drink since these conversations. This is when I got very angry and said a lot of things which I shouldn't have said, calling her irresponsible and comparing her to my dad and a plethora of other things to which she replied I was making it all about myself.   


I realised I don't have the knowhow of dealing with yet again another parent with alcohol issues, I have no tolerance towards it which is very unfair on my mum. I'm not taking it very well at all, I've been in bed for the past three days only to have her come into my room this evening to tell me she was going to the shop and for me not to get mad at her for buying more beers. Even typing this out is making me realise just how problematic this is and I just can't believe I never saw this happening right under my own eyes.   


I have a thousand things going through my mind. What's going to happen to her health? Is it going to get worse when I leave home? Should I leave home? How do I help her? Have I made it worse? Am I the reason?   


Anyway, this is all a bit of a shitshow isn't it? Any advice would be appreciated and apologies if this is the wrong place to post this.   
I'd also liked to add that if you are someone dealing with alcohol issues, carry on fighting through them because it's absolutely worth getting your sobriety back.   
I don't understand why such a toxic substance is legal. Take my story as an example of many which could have panned out very differently had alcohol not been a part of it.

He's been in bed all day and is really hurting. He asked the counselor if he could go on Friday.

I haven't mentioned this to him yet since he is resting but does anyone have any suggestions based on experience what would be better? Should we just wait and have him go on Sunday?

How we got here: Their drinking previously had worsened to on the order of a 2-3 half gallons of vodka per week, maybe more, over the last 2 months. For the previous 8+ months before that, ikt was more like 1 half gallon per week. Now they are very ill, sweaty, unable to eat or sleep.

Details: I recently returned from being on a work trip. Significant other is in substantial withdrawal symptoms and I am having a hard time handling/supporting it.  The first couple nights they claimed they were ¡°tapering¡± but ended up so drunk they fell/couldn¡¯t walk. They were taking shots of vodka essentially 24 hrs a day ¡°because they need them¡± and ¡°can¡¯t stop cold turkey¡± - I estimate near a pint of vodka yesterday and probably nearly a quart in the previous days. I understand completely stopping suddenly is dangerous, but I don¡¯t know how to actually convince them they aren¡¯t drinking less and that they need to.

As of last night, I got rid of \*most\* of the alcohol in the house and took them to a free clinic - they have no insurance. By good/terrible luck, the clinic confirmed alcohol withdrawals and prescribed them a small number of low dose alprazolam (12 @ 0.5mg). They are a larger person \~230lbs. They claim the doctors literally said ¡°take these and taper¡± with no specific schedule or further advice, which I don¡¯t buy.  

Today is the first day they had the prescription filled, and the first day they¡¯ve gone 12 hours w/o a drink (afaik). Some symptoms are very obviously real(sweaty, red face, unable to eat) some I can¡¯t tell if they¡¯re exaggerated (seeing/hearing things). They immediately took 3 of the 12 alprazolam and are still asking for alcohol saying they¡¯re going to die from seizures.

If I were to move out of the apartment she would have nowhere to go but I'm not sure if I can ride out our last 3 months of the lease with fears that she will relapse and another incident will occur. 

I gave her an ultimatum which is why she chose to go to the hospital, but even at the hospital when the social worker was speaking to her she wouldn't admit to drinking. 

I'm just looking for some guidance I'm sorry if this doesn't fit the rules of this sub."

alcoholism,cancerise,2020/4/20,"I¡¯m sober and going very strong, but I feel so guilty about having drunk in the first place....is it normal to keep looking back and regretting? (Background¡ªI [24F] started drinking heavily (frequent blackouts) last November and first tried quitting in February. Relatively short amount of time, but drinking is drinking and I went through the terrible emotions that come with addiction¡ªreliance on substance, sense of worthlessness, insecurity about feelings, heightened sense of depression) 

I¡¯m not struggling with the alcohol aspect right now and I don¡¯t see myself struggling with it in the near future either because I¡¯m determined to get my life together. I still have a lot of shit going on, but I¡¯d rather handle my problems sober even if it hurts to face. 

Now I¡¯m looking back at the last few months where I¡¯ve been drinking and I feel so disgusted with myself. I know it¡¯s in the past and I¡¯m better now, so why do I keep thinking about it and feeling guilty? 

I feel very stupid for wasting my time with alcohol. I¡¯ve made poor decisions and been rude towards several people while drunk. I¡¯ve ruined opportunities for myself because I was constantly too drunk or hungover to do anything productive. I stopped caring about my life and became hopeless cos I could forget about everything by drinking myself away. 

It¡¯s not good to regret, but I really hate myself for having fallen victim to alcoholism for a bit. I can¡¯t help but realise that I could be somewhere better in life right now if I hadn¡¯t freaked out and tried to run away from my problems with alcohol. I¡¯ve only made things worse for myself by pushing my problems aside and allowing them to grow bigger. 

I have slight hope for the future but hate my past and can¡¯t get over it right now."

Can drinking 5 beers (500ml %5) on weekends and other occasional off-days during the week cause withdrawal seizures or dt's ? I'm new to this sub and it made me afraid to even go out enjoy myself. How much drinking are we talking about when it comes to people having seizures or being hospitalized/dying ?

I feel often little semi conscious/high for few minutes after waking up from a deep sleep after caffeine crash or when I take cold medicine. It is only way, I know how being high feels like. I always wonder why would people want to lose their brain activity temporarily or be unconscious or high?"
alcoholism,nofeeela,2020/1/7,"Need an alternative 18 year old here who has decided that he has a binge drinking problem. Been going out every weekend for a while now with going to uni, drinking seems inevitable. Now I've realised my behaviour while drunk is getting worse. I'm getting aggressive drunk and causing more and more problems most recently causing a scene at the local metro station. My most recent one is the reason why I now I think I have a problem. Originally just going out for a few drinks at 4 o clock in the afternoon ended up with me sleeping rough at 4 in the morning. Lost my wallet and contact with my friend who I was supposed to be staying with that night. I can't drink in moderation anymore, I always drink to the extreme.

alcoholism,illsburydopeboy,2020/4/20,"Hit 2 years while in quarantine    It has been 2 years since my last drink, i posted on here last year after my 1 year mark. I may not post here often but this thread helps me get through tough times. I know a lot of people here are going through the struggle, just know you gotta keep trying. 
    Whether it¡¯s your first day or 5th year, stay aware, stay alert and stay sober. Choose to love yourself, choose the harder path and I swear it will reward you continuously. I¡¯m not saying it¡¯s a cheat code and life is perfect, but if you can harness that energy into something positive, wewf, amazing things happen. Just imagine if you put the energy you put into the lying and sneaking, planning your ways to get drinks. 
      Idk about you guys but I spent the majority of my time worrying about drinking, and once you remove that you realize other areas you can direct that focus/time.
    Everyone is on their own path and finds sobriety on their time, so I don¡¯t want anyone to feel berated or down talked, I just want anyone who¡¯s reading to know you are worth it. You deserve the things you dream, you deserve happiness and love, you deserve sobriety. Stay strong, stay sober"

I am not entirely sure if I have a problem. I have been advised by friends that I do have a problem jokingly, and I know I have a tendency to binge drink. I have ruined a relationship over things that I said while drunk, and have experienced more hangovers than I would like to think about. The thing is I get extremely excited to drink copious amounts and I like to get drunk not just feel a buzz. I know I have developed a slight dependency towards alcohol being in college and working at a bar. The only reason I am confused although many signs are there is that I am also a college student so often times my behavior feels normal as binge drinking in your early twenties is often normalized."

I¡¯ve had quite a hard couple of years, started taking drugs at 17 and finally quit about half a year ago. Started to take care of myself, training, taking antidepressants and went into que for getting a psychologist. I got the psychologist, keep taking my medication and still train. Then about two months ago I started drinking, I drink every night before bed. Can¡¯t handle my mind, I¡¯ve been very emotional unstable since about 11. Lots of problems in school with learning, my parents getting divorced, a dad for alcoholic, no friends and being asocial. I do have some friends now but life is complicated so we don¡¯t really see each other that much anymore. I work in a social environment but have lots of problems with my thoughts, specially when it comes to how people look at me.

alcoholism,wardquestion,2020/2/20,"ADHD medication ¡°cured¡± my alcoholism? This is in a way a success story but not one born out of my own willpower. For nearly the past 2 years I struggled a lot with drinking. As a girl with not much weight I was drinking 0,35-0,6 liters of vodka a night mixed with cola and other things. 

Well, last month I finally got a long overdue diagnosis for ADHD and got a prescription for Methylphenidate. I lied about my alcohol use because it would have probably denied a medication based treatment (or so was my assumption)

Well it¡¯s 1 month later and with the exception of 3 ciders spread over the month I pretty much lost the need to drink. I walk past the liquor section and the rising urge is as easily crushed as it comes up.

I assume the withdrawals were asked because I replaced it with a different chemical sensation? I just wanted to share this with people who might understand. 


I can¡¯t offer any wise words because I feel like I cheated my way to this... but I want to say to everyone here that I believe in you with all my heart and wish you all the best. For your loved ones, your health and your mental wellbeing.

alcoholism,Captain-Crouton,2020/1/6,"New here and scared of what my actions of drinking have turned into Hi there, I just need some guidance. 21 year old male in college. 

Small backstory: I found myself starting to drink harder and much more often once my ex-girlfriend cheated on me in July. I was piss drunk for about 2 weeks straight and have found myself drinking every day since it happened, and haven¡¯t gone without a drink maybe 5-7 days since July. Before this all happened, I only drank on the weekends. Now I can¡¯t even imagine not drinking in some sort of way. 

It stirred me into confusion about my future and if I should even stay in school. It has really deterred my grades and have had many drunken mistakes that would¡¯ve never happened before. 

I knew this became a problem once I started missing work from being too hungover and sleeping through work. I didn¡¯t even tell them I wasn¡¯t coming in, only to continue to drink for the rest of the day. 

All I think about is when I can drink next and how much of my money I am putting towards booze this week. 

I want to figure out ways to curb this. It sounds like I¡¯m becoming an alcoholic and would love some actual guidance from people who may have experience with this. 

Anything helps, thank you."
alcoholism,Mavattack28,2020/4/18,"Self Harm while drunk So I didnt know where to post this, I assumed people here would have the best answer. I am not a cutter or a drinker. Due to this quarantine I've been drinking more than usual. And by usual, maybe I'll get tipsy once every 3 months. Now I'm drinking like every other day. I have only cut myself once when I was in college and going through some severe depression a couple years ago. Anyways I've gone through a lot of therapy and such since that time and have never felt better. Even In this quarantine I've been quite positive, every time I drink or do get drunk the most harm I do is smoke a few more cigs than normal or send snaps to my friends about my love for henry cavills abs, no homo lmao. 
Last night while drunk, I was trying to work on a screenplay, I'm an independent Filmaker, and I could not put the words together or think of any transitions. I went for a sit down pee and saw the new box of razors just sitting there, and next thing I knew I had purposely cut myself 3 times over the healed scar. They were very light but still, I havent been suicidal or even depressed enough to think about suicide for at least 5 or 6 months. I still dont feel that way either now. I'm wondering if alchohol can make a person react to repressed emotions that I'm not realizing I still have. Does anyone have any personal experience with this?

TL;DR- I cut my arm on purpose while drunk. I have a history of semi-psychotic depression and suicidal thoughts but have gone through therapy. Is the alchohol retrieving repressed emotions.

Also I'm not gonna cry or kill myself over jokes, this is reddit and I never take myself too seriously."

alcoholism,Gimmemyspoon,2020/3/14,"How to give back trust My partner is an alcoholic; he has admitted it and is ""working on it.""  While he is definitely making some sort of attempt to control his drinking, he's still drinking a good bit daily and still drinking while at work occasionally. Granted he's not gotten blacked out or puked in my car for a couple of weeks now, I'm still having trouble trusting him about it at all. Several times in the past he has gotten black out and the broken up with me over stupid shit, only to conveniently forget about it by morning. He claims he doesn't want to break up or anything but I find it hard to believe that. So now I just feel it is almost impossible for me to actually trust him about anything at all. I'm always suspicious that he's at least had a little to drink and sometimes he's honest when he has, other times he's a complete liar about it. The more obviously wasted he is, the more likely he is to lie about it. 

He's sometimes really difficult to talk to about things like this. He gets very defensive, rarely apologizes,  and is just aggravated anytime I try to bring up past actions.  He acts like I'm just supposed to forget it all ever happened and just move forward, but that's hard to do when it has happened so many friggin times.   

I can't afford to do therapy right now, so can't work on it that way. Wondering what others have done to start trusting their alcoholic partners again. Also, no I am not open to any sort of alanon meetings.  I get they can be helpful for some, but I'm not one of those people."
alcoholism,SetogayaMari,2020/1/11,"How does alcohol affect your brain. I'm just asking because I feel like every Internet article tells you something different. It's also that everybody talks about the liver all the time but not really about your brain.
So after a lot of consumed alcohol, do your braincells really die and you can't get back your lost intelligence? Or are it just your synapses that get damaged and they can grow back if you use your brain often and think a lot?

But lately he has been complaining about how hot it is at work but it's literally below 70 degrees 
The reason I am uncertain is because he is quite a big guy and he can easily down a whole case of beer in a day and only starts too look tipsy after going through the box
From what I have seen he does it close to every other day.

So is it because he is big causing him to complain about the temperature or the excessive beer?"

My (F19) partner (M20) and I have been together for nearly 2 1/2 years. Since we started dating his dad has sunken into a deep depression that involves intense alcoholism. 
My partner and his brothers (20 &amp; 17) have tried so much to help him. Every time we go over to his house for dinner he gets drunk and goes into a deep depressive zone that my bf has to deal with. We rarely actually have dinner. 

My bf isn¡¯t a talker, so I¡¯m kept in the dark about quite a lot of the day to day details of his dad¡¯s life, but I know it¡¯s not going well. 
People his dads age are having a go at my bf and his brothers for not doing enough, and for not loving their father endlessly, despite having no idea how much time, effort and stress the boys put into helping their dad. 

Basically i guess I¡¯m trying to ask, how can I support my bf and his brothers through all this? I¡¯m a talker when it comes to emotions and stress, so to have my bf be the complete opposite has me at a loss. I¡¯m worried about their dad and them, but eometimes my bf will snap at me or crack it at me for asking how they¡¯re all doing, which is understandable because he¡¯s stressed about it, but it means I don¡¯t know how else to help him.

What kind of external support helped you through it all, whether being the child of an alcoholic or a former alcoholic yourself.

alcoholism,snitpickle,2020/1/25,"I'm just starting my journey to recovery and could really use some help      I'm 30 years old and been drinking heavily and pretty steady for about 8-9 years. I've had some ups and downs in how much I drank. But the last 4-5 years it got really bad, but I started to admit I had a problem. My wife, gf at the time started to push me to go to AA and seek help. I would go once or twice, maybe go a day or two with out drinking, but always fall back to it.  In the last couple years I began to hide it from her, which meant I also switched to vodka and other hard drinks to hide it easier. 
     I've also battled mental health issues most of my childhood, but stop taking meds right before I started drinking. No surprise I found alcohol at that point. 
About 3 days ago I stopped drinking after a hard 3 day bender. The last day I had something happen that brought up a lot of anxiety about my past. My younger years arent full of things that I'm regretful of, but there definitely are some events that haunt me. Long story short I have slept about 5 hours(in about 20max at a time) since Thursday(it is 4:42pm sat). I've been in a constant state of high anxiety and been through about 40 heavy panic attacks. I've opened up to my wife about things that are haunting me, and the drinking I've been hiding. We have decided to move into her parents house, and out of our rented house who we share with another heavy alcoholic. 
Last night I shot awake in another panic attack but had self harm thought, so I woke my wife and we went to the ER right away. Now I have a psych evaluation on Monday, and I'm not going to be left alone till then. 
I'm terrified of the challenges ahead of me. I'm terrified I'm going to start dieng from withdrawal. I know I have an amazing family to support me. I just want to talk to people who also struggle and have my diesise."

I've struggled with drug abuse in high school, never was an addict but I just liked pills a lot, I was taking them all the time. I snapped out of it around senior year and went completely sober for half a year, never picked them back up, but drank or smoked weed occasionally with friends. I got a job working in a winery two years ago and I would have my coworker give me wine all the time since they could often take some home, and around the same time was cheated on and sorta fell into my old habits just with drinking instead of pills. Stopped that after some friends told me they were concerned and went sober for a bit again. Over the past 6 or 7 months, I've consistently been what my friends call a ""dad drinker"". probably three to four nights a week I have a beer or two, that's it. Some weekends I will actually get drunk, but i just have a beer or two a few nights a week. Obviously I am not 21 and technically shouldn't be drinking at all, but I like the taste and I get really worked up and a beer at the end of some days helps. I find that I am craving it at night more than I used to and I am worried that when I'm 21 in a few months it might get worse, but that could just be my anxiety. It doesn't affect any aspect of my life, I do well in school, my relationships are great, I just feel like I shouldn't want it(alcohol), you know? I can't imagine ever being in the places I used to be with substances again, but I just feel so guilty for my small habit, especially since about half of my friend group at college are straightedge punk people abstain from substances, although they don't mind at all if anyone uses (responsibly) of course. I really hope this is the right place for this, I just feel so guilty even though I feel like my consumption is pretty normal for most people who drink. Does anyone have any advice to offer?

alcoholism,Icarus_818,2020/2/9,"I need some third-party advice. Hello,

I apologize if this isn¡¯t an appropriate topic, I¡¯m just seeking advice. 

I suddenly became disabled last year, lost my career and agency from it and have had to move back in with my parents while I receive medical treatment and fight to regain my life. 

My younger brother (32) has never moved out of my parents house and has been an alcoholic since he was 17. My parents have done all manner of things from therapy to inpatient to try and help him to no avail. Recently, he called our mother a cunt. This is totally unacceptable.

I went to confront him about it (and was naturally angry) and while verbally I should have handled it better, it ended up with him beating me until I was on the ground (and he kept kicking me in the face and chest even when I was trying to get away to save my life.) He was drunk, as per usual. The police came, saw how badly beaten I was, and filed felony domestic assault charges against him. This was 3 days after I¡¯d had a seizure, fallen and sustained a traumatic brain injury, so he knew I was extraordinarily weak.

alcoholism,life_is_an_addiction,2020/3/21,"Want to start drinking.... I recently partied 3 weeks back to back as two of my closest friends were getting married to each other. 1st week: Bachelor Party, 2nd week: Destination Wedding, 3rd week: Saint Patrick's Day

Each week I reconnected with old friends, ate amazing food, traveled to new cities/countries, and drank. Drank a lot. 

I'm not one who drinks regularly, but when I do, I tend to binge. Last time I drank was New Years when I didn't pace myself and blacked out. This time around I was a bit more careful, but surprised myself at how well I could hold my alcohol.

On several occasions, I had 16+ shots over 2-3 hours and didn't lose my shit. No blacking out, puking, or passing out. In fact, what I remember most is that feeling of happiness. Whether it was cans of Whiteclaw, shots of ice cold Tito's, or crisp ginger beer + Jameson, I miss that feeling of warmth and joy that alcohol gave me.

Now, back home in the states I'm self-quarantined at my parent's house for 14 days and find myself craving some Jameson and Whiteclaw. This is the very first time I've wanted to drink by myself and I'm a bit concerned.

Looking inwards, I have a void. A sort of hollowness that I'm constantly looking to fill somehow. Whether it's reddit/youtube, swiping through dating apps, or chatting with randoms to pass the time, I've been distracting myself constantly to avoid the void.

I'm craving connection, but haven't been able to find it and I fear that the warmth of alcohol will be replacing it..."
alcoholism,ConzT,2020/2/4,"How can I help a friend to accept that he has a problem and help him to rehab? A friend of my family who I have also known for years has a problem with alcohol which led him to get kicked out by his girlfriend(also long term friend of my family) at the end of december. since he doesn't have a job he went to visit his son in another country where he got kicked out aswell after a few weeks. Now he is currently back in my city where he stays at his moms as far as I know.
In person, I have never seen him completely wasted but heard stories from different people. When he usually comes to visit my city he would always stay at a friend's house who I visited a lot and he always had a few drinks as soon as it got dark and always stayed up late and sleep until noon. But he is banned there aswell. Years ago it was beer and wine and about two years ago he switched to gin. He sometimes messages me and others random texts in the middle of the night(1am - 6am),with the worst one beeing he will kill himself. Next day when I read it and called him he said it was just a joke. 

Now why do I think, although I am not as close to him as others, that I have the right/that it's my ""duty"" to help him? 
I have been in a similar situation a few months ago, although my addiction wasn't alcohol but video games. I went to rehab where most people were alcoholics or addicted to pills and from my experience, we are all not that different and reach to our substance for similar reasons. So I do feel that I understand him to a certain point and help him by going to the same clinic.

Yesterday I sent him a long text message that he should consider rehab, I want to help him, share my experience in more detail with him than before, answer all his questions and how it affected me and was the best decision I have ever made. And I will not tell anyone about this. (Which is true because it's a not so easy topic) 

That was probably not the most clever move but I just said fuck it, I have to be honest to him and just tell him straight away. That's how it worked for me when friends and family sat me around a table and confronted me. 

I sent him that message at 9am, he read it a few hours later and I got a reply the next day at 2am. 
Of course he denied it. His answer was that he doesn't know who's spreading those rumors and that he was at a hospital in his son's country and he came back to my city to get a better diagnose. (This is true to some point since he had an issue with his pancreas years ago, and still does apparently. What a coincidence...) Also he asked if his brother spread those rumors, that he is an alcoholic and that his brother is just jealous of him. 

I must agree that his brother is a heavy drinker aswell but he has his life together! 

Now I don't know what to do further and how to answer on his last message and especially how to   help him accept it. 

Sorry for the long post but I hope that you can help me! Thank you very much!!"
alcoholism,bezosboss,2020/1/15,"Looking for tips on addressing a loved ones alcoholism. Hello all.

Not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I am looking for some tips and advice on what to do and how to approach my father to speak with him about his alcoholism. 

He is a very highly functioning alcoholic, with many many years under his belt. Him and I have a wonderful relationship, and he respects me very much. But I have never confronted him about his alcoholism before. Honestly, his drinking has never had a negative physical impact on me, he has never been abusive (physically, verbally, or otherwise) to me. I can¡¯t say the same for my brother and sister though, he can be very mean and verbally abusive when he gets belligerent and it has caused a tremendous strain on his relationship with my sister. For me though, it just makes me tremendously sad.

A few years back things got bad when he was arrested for a domestic dispute, and I had really hoped that it was a wake up call for him but it doesn¡¯t seem so. Us kids are all grown up now in our 20s but he recently had another son who is 3 now (who I love very much). He has expressed to me that he is looking to be a better father for his new son, and I think that is wonderful. He hasn¡¯t been the worlds greatest dad but he is my best friend and beneath his troubles he is a good man. I had thought things had gotten better until recently.

It was brought to my attention during a visit a few months ago by his wife that he started drinking again. Low and behold I found his stash, about 8 or so handles of various liquor, many at least half empty. It broke my heart. And over Christmas we had gone to visit and he was openly drinking. I haven¡¯t seen him drink in 3 years... I am not naive, it wasn¡¯t surprising to hear that he was drinking again. But to actually see it... and then to add on to the shock, later in the night in front of his wife and my fianc¨¦, he offered whiskey in my cider, and on impulse I had accepted. Just as he started pouring whiskey into my drink my heart SANK and i felt nothing but regret and disgust for myself, normalizing his behavior. 

I am just so worried. For years, time and time again, he has been able to get out of trouble because he can afford good lawyers, and truthfully he has never felt real life-affecting consequences as a result of his actions. It¡¯s only a matter of time before he hurts himself, someone else or his family...

I just want to talk to him about it because as I said, I have never talked to him about it, confronted him, nothing. He has so much going for him, a wonderful handsome baby boy and a wife who cares about him very much, but she is starting to lose control and is realizing it and has reached out to me and my fianc¨¦ for help, something, anything. I know that it¡¯s not actually my job to do that, but since I have never tried before in my life, I really want to.

Im afraid that he isn¡¯t going to live much longer if he continues to unravel. Whether it be liver cancer, rolling his car drunk, or losing his family and blowing his brains out or something horrible, I truly do not think its going to end well.  

Any advice or tips or anything would be wonderful and much appreciated. Sorry for the rant too, I don¡¯t really get to express this often at all since my family doesn¡¯t really talk about it and I only have my fianc¨¦ to about this."

I can't really talk about it to other people because everyone has their own issues and I don't want to stress with them with mine.

alcoholism,DirectAirline,2020/2/7,"My moms alcoholism is getting worse. So my mom has been a heavy drinker for a while. For the past couple of years she usually has her first glass of wine at about 4 or 5 pm and keeps going until she goes to bed. This means, since I was unable to drive yet, I was trapped at home every day after 4 pm. If I had asked her to drive me somewhere she definitely would because she either doesn¡¯t believe she¡¯s intoxicated or thinks I just don¡¯t notice, but I knew what was up so I just never asked to be driven around in the evening.  But in the past 6 months or so, it¡¯s gotten bad. I¡¯m older now so whenever I¡¯m with her I can thankfully offer to drive. She doesn¡¯t just drink at night anymore, it can be any time of day. Some times she actually drank WHILE driving me around. I think she really truly is convinced that I don¡¯t notice, despite how painfully obvious it is due to how bad she is at hiding her drinking, despite how hard she tries to hide it. She¡¯s never uttered the world alcohol, drunk, or let me writhing 5 feet of one of her drinks since the beginning of her disease. She almost never appears drunk though, because she must have an extremely high tolerance at this point. I¡¯m guessing the recent increase in drinking is just to avoid withdrawals. Thankfully I only have to deal with this every other week since my parents are divorced and have split custody. Sometimes I reallly want to vent to my dad but I know he¡¯d make a whole big deal out of it and something big would happen. I don¡¯t want any confrontation or burnt bridges, and I know for a fact this would happen if she knew I was talking about her drinking. Idk it¡¯s just kind of disheartening that she¡¯s so careless about my life that she drove me around drunk or so clueless that she doesn¡¯t see the risk.  I don¡¯t really know what to do at this point. Either she¡¯s in extreme denial or delusion, or simply just doesn¡¯t care anymore. I¡¯ll be off at college soon and won¡¯t have to worry about it. I¡¯m positive the liver disease and brain damage will catch up to her soon, and hopefully be a big wake up call."

alcoholism,Arbsbuhpuh,2020/2/28,"TIL that humanity is really just an absolute fuck-ton of semi-hairless sentient apes, trying their best to stumble through an increasingly complex environment that they are increasingly less equipped to deal with. Long read, but I mostly just want to write it out.

I just convinced my little brother to voluntarily get locked up in an inpatient detox center. I went with him and helped fill out the paperwork.

He has been to one once before that traumatized him, but he trusts me enough to go even though he's scared shitless and essentially believes he's stepping into a hell that he can't leave.

Words can never express how much I hope I made the right call. 

He was trying to detox at my house, we went through 6 days of ever-increasingly worse symptoms, all while he was holding himself to 20 standard drinks per day so that he doesn't die.

He is a god-damned warrior. Eventually it got to the point where he couldn't keep any liquids down at all, even alcohol, so we supplemented with low doses of benzos to keep him from going into full blown withdrawals until he could keep something down. 

I was with him night and day caring for him, watching him suffer and wishing I could make it easier on him.

I told him on the night of the 6th day that he needed to go to the detox center.

Then, the morning of the 7th day, he was doing so much better I was reconsidering. Back and forth, back and forth I weighed the cost of potential trauma with the possibility that he could die in my care because I'm not a medical professional. Maybe this was finally the turning point? Would I be wasting thousands of dollars of his money and abandoning everything right when the whole goddamn thing was almost over?

I don't know.

I never will know.

I feel like I abandoned him when he needed me the most, *again*, just like everyone else. Seriously, he has had an absolute nightmare of a life, a lot of which I never realized until he started telling me about some of it. Some of it he says is too horrible to tell.

He has never hurt a person except in self defense, and the world and every medical professional or therapist he's ever told the truth to has let him down...even me. What a fucked up situation.

I still made the best call I could. I just hope it was the right one."

alcoholism,Papaverpalpitations,2020/3/26,"Searching for help Hey everyone, first time posting on this sub. 

I've been drinking since I was 13 years old (I'm 25 now), and I remember the first time I ever drank I stole beers from the fridge at my parents house during summer break and had one beer-and one beer quickly turned to 7. I was completely alone during that first time I drank, and I've been binge drinking by myself ever since. I cannot control myself when it comes to alcohol. 

I started using opiates about 2 years ago, but quit within the last few months. During that time, I wasn't drinking but since I've stopped using opiates, my drinking has ramped up again and I've essentially replaced one substance with another. I've been diagnosed with poly substance abuse disorder by numerous doctors, but have never seen the urgency to stop using or drinking whatever is available to me. My life has never drastically fallen apart, and I've actually gotten my shit together recently. However, alcohol is still that beast that lurks in the shadows of my mind and I've never really been able to completely stop. I know that if I don't quit, my life will inevitably reach that breaking point-I just don't know when or how it will happen. 

I'm getting to the point where I feel regret the morning after drinking, but that regret has never been enough to get me to quit. I realize I need to stop, but I honestly don't know how to defeat this. I've been to AA meetings a few times, but I've never stuck with it. 

How do I stop drinking? I feel helpless at this point and I know I need to quit, but I honestly don't have a clue of how I'd do that. Can anyone share some sage advice, or even personal experiences with quitting? What was the moment when you finally had enough? What helps you stay sober, and how did you go about getting sober?"

Over the past two months I have cut my drinking down to 2-3 times per week, but still put away 10-12 beers per session.  In the last 2 weeks, I have drank 3 times, and as of this post, have not had a drink in 4 days.  

My doctor prescribed me Naltrexone, 50mg, and I've taken it once.  That one time, I took it with several other meds and I woke up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and I think I was hallucinating.  Everything looked fuzzy, almost like the A-Ha video for Take on Me.  

Is this a side effect of the Naltrexone or the combo of scripts I took?  I've been taking meds for anxiety and a pinched nerve in my back, but have never had the above experience before until I took the Naltrexone with the rest of my meds.  My pharmacist said I could take Naltrexone with the other meds and it would just increase drowsiness, but I was not expecting hallucinations.

I see posts and such on people getting really sick due to withdrawals, is the Naltrexone going to prevent this, or is it strictly to help me stay away from alcohol?

alcoholism,Throwaway2836l920,2020/1/19,"Advice? I don't know how to talk to my mom about her drinking.

Background - a bunch of really crappy stuff has been happening to my mom the last couple of years, causing her to spiral into depression and alcohol abuse, culminating in her her being hospitalized for suicidally and an attempt twice this last year, her not taking to me for the six months between the two hospitalizations and her being homeless for part of that time. Prior to this year, she hasn't had major issues, we've always been really close. After her hospitalization and attempt she contacted me again and apologized for pushing me away. She's been living on my couch for about 7 months now. She has no job and no savings. We have no family. 

Most of this time she's been good - not drinking (at least that I could tell) I was trying to get her to seek active treatment but she doesn't have insurance, doesn't want meditation, and actively lied to and manipulates her therapists/doctors in the hospital to get released she admitted - and this expressed a derision to talk to someone. I've tried to encourage her to try to seek help however suits her - whether she wants to try mindfulness based relapse prevention or if she wants to try to volunteer somewhere to get her doing something.  I didn't press it because it seemed like she was doing better - I guess I just really wanted to believe it. Hoped she'd realize it with some space.

Thursday afternoon she was sleeping at the wrong time when I got home. She's been actively drunk or asleep since then.  She has:

1) fallen over. Repeatedly.
2) tried to use the bathroom in our closet. Twice.
3) not been able to form coherent sentences at times
4) yelled, screamed, cried, repeated phrases over and over, jumped topics, etc
3) gotten convinced that a maintenance guy outside was trying to kill her, screamed at him, then hid and cried

She literally can't follow a conversation now and I can't sleep. She's stubborn and so so angry right now. I'm trying to wait until she's sober enough to impress that I cannot do this. But she has nothing else and will probably die/kill herself if she's put in the street. I'm worried she's going to get the cops called on her or I'll get kicked out of my house when someone complains.  Hospital doesn't seem to help because they can't hold her long enough to get through and she's intelligent enough to fake it when even pretty drunk.

I guess I'm asking for any tips for how to talk to her without just kicking her out?
Magic anyone?

I've blacked out before, I've embarrassed myself before, but this was a new low. The next day I reached back out to her and apologized profusely, she told me she had never witnessed someone pass out like that (so great, she saw everything) that it was okay and not to worry about it, but I am worried about it and it's not okay.

I am trying now to form a new habit which is drinking only during the weekend to socialize with people.
Since two weeks, I realized that I have to take my issue with Alcohol Addition seriously. So, I stopped drinking as I used to during the week days. I usually drink only when invited by some friends, old classmates, and old coworkers too.
Here is what I want to know. Even if I did not drink for like three days, especially at night or even during some discussions, I feel I am somehow drunk. Also, my voice slows down greatly. Did this happen to any of you during the process of gradually stopping drinking alcohol? Thanks in advance."

I¡¯m not the stereotypical drinker or alcoholic, I go through phases, I¡¯ll go a week having 5-7 beers a night (doesn¡¯t take much for me to feel good) than I¡¯ll go a week maybe having 2-3 beers in total, I never considered it a huge problem because I could go without drinking fairly easily. However with this covid shit and less structure in my day I¡¯ve been drinking a lot more. Yesterday was my first day not drinking since this quarantine all started and it was tough, I couldn¡¯t sleep, felt like my heart was beating faster than usual, I ready some withdrawal symptoms and now my anxiety is at an all time high.  even without drinking I struggle with anxiety, so I¡¯m wondering if maybe I¡¯m just overthinking everything and I just need to tough it out, or if I should seek actual help.

I've never been addicted to alcohol before this. Had a lot of crazy shit happen in my life and I've now been drinking Everclear mixed with whatever sweet drink I had on hand for 2 weeks straight. Had maybe a day off each time.

How bad are the withdrawals gonna be? I have some Clonazolam (a research chemical benzodiazapine) on hand that could help with withdrawal. I noticed tonight I was feeling extra cold, anxious, shaky, etc before I drank some.

Are there any tapering guides? Should I just drink a tiny bit just enough to not feel bad? I'm usually pretty commited and can control myself when tapering off something like this. I'm very stubborn and will usually just push through any withdrawals as I did with kratom (shout out to /r/quittingkratom)

But now it's been a solid month without alcohol and I'm having a really difficult time. I feel like the physical ache to drink is gone, but I'm dealing with a lot of mental and emotional turmoil, lately. I feel psychologically restless and weak. I've lost all control over my emotions, and will periodically cry for no reason at all. I can't control it. In the daytime, I'm usually fine. I can go about my business, no problem. But when the sun goes down and I'm able to think, I just feel despair. I realize I haven't developed any interesting hobbies or past times. I would literally just scroll through my phone and drink a dozen beers (which is excessive anyway, but especially for being a 5-foot nothing female). I've been writing and journaling, reading and getting into spirituality and whatnot. But, god I just feel this sadness deep in my guts. And the sadness is starting to creep into daytime hours. When changing into my uniform at work today, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and starting tearing up, for no reason at all. Thankfully, I was able to stop it then, without full-on crying. I know it will get better with time and I know that a large part of it has to do with seasonal depression issues. I try to remember that alcohol won't solve my problems and how guilty and sick I would feel with myself the next day. I'm just sad, is all."

I felt betrayed, lied to by others, and was made to feel like a crazy person when I asked if there was a problem. This drinking happened all throughout my childhood and when I asked for help I was told it was natural to have fights with parents, etc.

I've just recently started college and was having  some problems and went to my college's referral center and ended up being referred off campus for substance abuse disorder because the school says there's nothing they can provide. I only have my parents insurance and there's no way I can do anything through that. And paying out of pocket is a no go too.

My boyfriend was out this morning and when I looked at his calendar (I help with his real estate business), I saw that he had an AA meeting for noon that he put in the night before. I was surprised because I knew he used to go but then decided that he didn¡¯t really feel like an alcoholic and honestly I haven¡¯t noticed any problems, especially since we spend most of the week sober. Nonetheless, I¡¯m very proud that he reflected on things and decided to take action on something he saw as an issue.

He got home while I was cooking lunch and showed me his 24 hour chip after a few minutes of talking about my morning. I hugged him and kissed his cheek and said I was proud of him. I also asked later what made him want to go. He said he just hates how he spends at least half of his nights a week getting drunk and not remembering what he did, then struggling to get up in the morning and losing half of the next day. He told me he wants to be able to take care of me and his family.

I¡¯m a bit confused because I genuinely didn¡¯t see an issue. He did see one and that¡¯s what¡¯s important. I have no problem with his newfound (refound?) sobriety and honestly am just really proud that he has the personal insight and honesty to go to a meeting after being away for so long. 

However, my only real interaction with these types of groups are with my brother who very begrudgingly went to NA for a few months after my parents put him in a rehab program and then once he was financially independent, stopped going to meetings. What did you wish your loved ones told you? Is saying I¡¯m proud patronizing? How can I best support him? Can I ask my boyfriend questions about why he felt like things were out of control or is that too prying? What would be good to ask? And what were you thinking when you told someone you went to a meeting for the first time?

I hope my surprise didn¡¯t come off as apathy, I just wanted to think about what to tell him before I did. This man is the love of my life and I want to be as supportive as possible."

alcoholism,anothathrowaway1337,2020/2/24,"I relapsed last night... Hello Reddit, I'm George from Turkey (not my real name). I felt like writing my thoughts down so I decided to do it here.   

&amp;nbsp;

I don't see myself as an alcoholic, rather a fellow who likes drinking more than people around me. I'm in my early 20s and studying computer science in a fairly prestigious school. I didn't start consuming alcohol before my last year of high school. Well, I did drink beer before but I stopped quite soon and never had 2 drinks in a day. Most of my friends had started consuming alcohol at that point, I started drinking late relative to my friend circles. I guess that's because of my religious parents who don't drink or smoke. According to them they never did so.

&amp;nbsp;

I relapsed last night with my friends from school, after a break of 27 days. This was a big deal for me since I had never truly stopped drinking since I started drinking in high school, which was 4 years ago. I think it is fair to say I did not have a week without alcohol in these 4 years. I always fancied a drink, I don't really recall any point where I thought it was a bad idea to drink. I had some problems because of my drinking attitude, I guess some of them were a big deal, but I think I always found a way to find a place for alcohol in my life. I like to blame my parents for this, I always thoughts drugs (including alcohol) in a way that demonizing them past the point they deserve. I realize blaming my parents will not get me anywhere though.

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like this break taught me a lot of things, gained me a lot of perspectives, I learned how to see circumstances under a sober view. I also improved my self-trust, I know for a fact I can control alcohol now. I think this break had a lot of positive impacts on me, I might just take some breaks from time to time. I'm going to try being sober on weekdays and stick to drinking in Fridays and Saturdays.

I think I'm going to stop here, I might add some stuff later. Be safe fellas."

alcoholism,kennyz6,2020/1/30,"How can I (F21) effectively help my mom (F42) who¡¯s become an alcoholic over the last couple years, without hurting our relationship 
A little back story: growing up, I hardly remember my mom ever drinking. She was always sober even when her friends weren¡¯t, if she did drink, it was one or two beers and she always bragged how she never drank hard liquor. My parents divorced when I was 11, and it seems the couple years after that she began to drink more. Fast forward to now, she drinks all the time. Every day, and a lot. Pepsi and whiskey is her weakness, and ultimately it¡¯s what gets her the most fucked up. 

I moved two hours away for college a little over a year ago so I kind of pushed these thoughts to the back of my mind, because I¡¯m no longer constantly exposed to the toxic environment. I just ended up moving back to finish my last two years of school (I got placed here for the program I¡¯m in, I did not choose to come here) 

My moms a great mom, her friends, her family, teachers, other parents, everyone tells her all the time how caring and loving she is for her kids, and every other kid she crosses paths with, and she is. When she¡¯s sober. Getting drunk is really her major downfall. I almost feel as if she prioritizes drinking over some things that she shouldn¡¯t. It¡¯s definitely gotten worse over the years and it breaks my heart that it¡¯s getting so bad. 

Alcoholism definitely runs in my family, her parents were alcoholics until their mid thirties, and now my grandma is constantly talking about how great it is to be sober. 

It¡¯s just so hard to get through to my mom because she doesn¡¯t see an issue. She doesn¡¯t understand who she becomes when she¡¯s drunk or how bad it is and the issues she can cause for everyone around her- she can get decently mean (not physical, just verbal) She sees no problem with it at all, and I don¡¯t know how to effectively convey the message that she¡¯s ruining her life, as well as her children¡¯s, and it¡¯s pushing all of us away. 

I guess my biggest question is,  how can I appropriately address this situation and essentially tell her I¡¯m distancing myself until she doesn¡¯t drink every day. I¡¯ve been tempted to when she¡¯s drunk and I¡¯m pissed at her but I know that won¡¯t be effective and will only be more harsh and probably make her angry.

alcoholism,veggiebum,2020/1/7,"Embarrassed to go to an event. Last Spring I went with my boyfriend to a work event of his (his boss' birthday party). I got too drunk and made a huge idiot of myself. I fell, and apparently I said something not very nice to his manager, causing us to abruptly leave. I don't remember what happened and when I asked my boyfriend to apologize to his coworkers for me and try to find out what happened, the consensus was that a lot of people at that party were really drunk and no one remembers what happened, remembers seeing me fall, and his boss ""doesn't remember"" me being rude to him. My paranoid self if telling me that everyone is just being polite and not mentioning what happened, especially his boss. He was apparently pretty drunk too. All of this is supposed to make me feel slightly better about what happened, but it didn't. 

After that event I decided to stop drinking entirely. I have always had a problem with alcohol. It wasn't so much that I couldn't say no to a drink... I could go months without drinking. But when I start drinking, I just can't seem to stop, and always needed to be the drunkest person there. It does not help that I just wasn't a good drunk. I get angry quickly and just.. wasn't a good drunk. I have done so many things in my years of drinking (I am 27) that led to just awful decisions, awful outcomes and permanent, long-lasting negative things. 

It has been almost 8 months of no drinking and I have never been happier in my entire life. I love waking up after a party knowing exactly what happening, waking up without crippling anxiety about what I said or did. There have been times when it's been a little difficult and people press as to why I'm not having a drink. But I've learned how to react and respond in these situations. 

This started as a year of no drinking, but now that I have started this life, with how happy I am, I know I'm going to continue it. It would be nice to one day have control over how much I drink and be able to have one drink on a night out. But I don't see that happening right now because I am just so happy. My boyfriend (now fiance) and I are the absolute best we have ever been and everything else in my life is just falling into pieces. I honestly never realized how much those nights of drinking were adding to my overall anxiety. I would always lie to myself and say that I didn't have a problem, even after a night out that went horrible wrong that was meant to be just a night out with friends to get some drinks. I didn't know that this affected all of the aspects of my life. My career is booming, my mental and physical health are booming and all the relationships in my life seem.. clearer and better somehow. 

However, this upcoming weekend, I have a another work event for my fiance, a wedding of his coworker. All the same people will be there that were there last spring when I made a total ass of myself. I am so nervous. I keep telling myself that I have almost 8 months of evidence that I am not that person who they saw that night, and that I am working towards bettering my life. But no matter what, I think myself back into being nervous to see all of them. I'm nervous to see his boss, nervous to see his female coworkers that must have judged me for being such an ass. I wish I could cancel or play sick but I know I have to go. I don't know if I apologize or just leave it alone and have a good time... I'm just so nervous. And I'm also nervous for them to see that I'm not drinking at all and to judge that I can't drink otherwise I'll turn into the person they saw last time. I've come up with a hundred excuses why I can't go and feel like I'm being such a quitter."

Hi friends.

I'd like to stop drinking, and I think I have what it takes to do so. My issue is that since I've been regularly drinking 4-6+ beers nightly, on days that I decide not to, I'm hit with panic and anxiety.

It only really happens at night, as that's when I would typically drink. Rarely if ever (maybe a weekend game or something) do I drink before the evening. My anxiety manifests itself via ""ooh I'm having a heart attack"" and I think I'm dying. I succumb and drink a few beers to make that go away, but it's always the urge to have that panic stop, more so than ""god I'd really like a beer right now"".

I need to learn how or what to replace alcohol in this equation. I think I'm mentally tough enough but a few reads on here have me concerned for my safety. I don't thiiiiiink I'd have serious withdrawals aside from extreme boredom, but is that possible with my usage?

If the responses (which I very much appreciate) are that I should see a doctor, can someone please outline what exactly that would entail? I just want to know that when the panic sets in, that I'm actually safe and can just hunker down and endure until it passes.

On that note, how long does that take to go away if anybody here has had similar experiences? I know there's a lot of questions in this post but I appreciate anybody taking the time to help me out. 25 y/o male if that is relevant.

alcoholism,panicqueen8,2020/3/1,"How to become sure if your spouse is an alcoholic or beginning to become one? Hi everyone! I recently got married to the love of my life and we have been in a relationship for more than 10 years. I always knew he likes to drink and he would drink 1 - 2 times in a week. Some months before our wedding, he reduced his drinking to drinking once in 2 weeks. I was extremely happy to see this change. But post our wedding, he's been drinking 3 - 4 times in a week!!! He has some reason or the other. Often the reason is that he is under a lot of work pressure (which is true) and due to that he often comes home late from work in a drunk state. When he brings home office work, he brings along an alcohol of his choice and drinks a few pegs while doing his office work. I have also noticed that whenever he meets his close friends, that meeting is never sober. He and his friends will definitely drink. He also drinks with me at home when he is cooking a non-vegetarian dish. I have seen that alcohol often does not have a good effect on him. After drinking, he becomes unexpectedly over-romantic, egoistic, hyper, does everything slow, gets easily ticked off and often repeats his talks. All this drives me nuts and these habits are beginning to hamper our relationship, his mood and behaviour. Everytime I have a conversation with him about this problem, he vows that he will soon quit it. Those vows don't seem to be getting fulfilled.

I can¡¯t and won¡¯t go into detail about what happened that night, but y¡¯all know what happens when you drink that much, and if my fianc¨¦ wasn¡¯t there I know that I would have died. I think that this was a huge wake up call that I can¡¯t let myself get bad again, because now I have so much to look forward to, and I almost threw it all away for some drinks. I just feel stupid right now. And mortified, remorseful, thankful, scared... just so many emotions that I can¡¯t even begin to process."
alcoholism,andrewjrivers,2020/2/16,"My Dad is 30 Years Sober. My dad celebrated 30 years of sobriety on Halloween, of all nights. So my brother and I went to an AA meeting with him ([photo of him with his candle](https://www.facebook.com/events/2480731532052307/)). It was a cool experience and really special that he shared it with us.  
I'm a comedian, so,  constant travel, performing in nightclubs and getting paid in free drinks made my relationship with alcohol difficult. One night my best friend drove me home in my car while I puked out the window of the backseat. The whole time I was trying to say ""I'm sorry about this. I love you."" in between gasps of air. I drove the car to get detailed in the morning, and told the guy my friend puked to save face. It was pretty humiliating. I could keep lying to everyone but I knew the truth. Even while I was puking, I realized how annoyed my friend must be. and the next morning looking through my texts, I realized I was straining other relationships even if they weren't present at the night out.

After that night, I started writing a joke about drinking in moderation. I called it ""2 drinks is the new midnight."" -It's my dad's favorite joke and I thought I'd share it in here. Hopefully you'll get a chuckle and maybe even find some inspiration.

alcoholism,butcherman480,2020/3/11,"Struggling, bad. A couple weeks ago, I fell, hard, off the wagon and had a drink.  Well, a lot of them.

I had a small detox period and was doing great again, but my mother was just admitted to hospital with a severe infection coming from a tiny little cut on her right index finger.  It's spread, very quickly through her hand and into her arm, and they fear there might be sepsis, in her blood.  She isn't doing well now, and I can't be there with her, because where I work, I'm exposed to all kinds of possible infectious things, and she is on isolation atm.

So I'm sitting here, at home, freaking out.  She was already not well, COPD, CHF, renal insufficiency, and HTN.  So this could be bad, in a big way.  The call to run to the store and grab a metric fuck-ton of alcohol, and drink till I pass out is loud, and I don't know how much longer I can resist.

I know it won't help me, or even more, won't help her, but I don't know how else to stop myself from overthinking it and freaking out.

alcoholism,FormalDisaster2,2020/3/18,"Coronavirus is making me realize I might have a problem I've been drinking every day for the past month. I kept telling myself it was because my birthday was coming up and I was celebrating (and depressed). Then it was because I was on a mini vacation (and depressed). Lately, it's been because of social distancing and being bored (and depressed). I stocked up on wine and already went through it in two days. I would probably be drinking even if we weren't being asked to stay inside but the isolation makes it feel like the weekend, which is when I drink the most. I tell myself to not drink during the week because of work (mostly successful) and then go wild on the weekend. But, like I said, it's been a month now. 

I keep thinking it's not that bad and that I don't have a problem. But it's been building up for a while. I've wondered if I might have a problem since I can't just have one drink and because I think it'll make me feel better when I'm depressed.

alcoholism,OGKebabEater,2020/4/6,"Get Sober on the beaches of Reddit Nation  

Hello all,

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

the subbreddit is reddit.com/[r/theredditnation](https://www.reddit.com/r/theredditnation/)

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure  

   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy (for now I will be the ¡°king¡±)  

      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building  

      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services  

      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port  

      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing  

      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island  

      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location  

   1. Set up the island as a luxury city  

      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island  

      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven  

      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island  

      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure  

   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself  

   * 500,000
* The Port  

   * 200,000 to build  

      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry  

      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings  

   * 1,000,000  

      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services  

   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation  

   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification  

   * 50,000
* Food Supply  

   * We will purchase MRE¡¯s and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island  

   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)  

   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include  

      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.  

   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale  

      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax  

   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation  

      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

alcoholism,cludo88,2020/1/18,"Mother is alcoholic, don't know what to do My mother has binge drunk most her life, shes 57, the thing is drink seems to affect her abnormaly, she changes into a completely different person, an evil horrible person with the mentality of an infant, it's literally like the exorcist, and I hate the person she is while shes drunk.

New year's eve she took an overdose and shes drinking every day now, it's hard to be there for her because I hate her when shes drunk, any sympathy I feel for her is insincere when shes drunk and it's just hard to maintain, she has done unforgivable things while drunk but I quickly forgave her for all of them, for example boxing day she told me her now ex bf gave her a black eye, after seeing the 'black eye' I immediately payed him a visit and attacked him. Turns out she just had a rash around her eyes and she was lying.

On top of the drink she is severely depressed, she still dwells on things that happened 30 years ago, shes never changed, theres been no personal growth her whole life, shes just stuck in the same destructive loop.

She has no drive to do anything about it.

I am the only person in the world who she trusts, I don't want to abandon her, but I have ambitions, strict routines to follow to get where i want to go.

She ruined my mental health as a child, i was going down the same road as her but iv broke her legacy, my life is dedicated to personal growth.

I don't want to sacrifice my own life for hers because shes not doing anything about her issues, nothing, no effort.

She says she has an alcoholics meeting Tuesday but I am 90 percent sure she won't go.

Her mom, dad and sister are all dead and before they died they all became victims of endless depression, also alcoholism aside from her sister.

I just don't know what to do, I have started having reaccuring horrible nightmares involving her when shes drunk.

Her sense of dread and hopelessness is infectious, the more I'm there with her, the more she drags me down.

Any advice is appreciated."
alcoholism,vagueblanche,2020/3/7,"Didn't know where else to ask: Did I experience symptoms of Alcohol deprivation? I've been drinking almost daily the past 3 weeks (Traveling, enjoying myself - usually don't drink more than 4-5 times a month, or sometimes go without for several months).

The drinks ranged from beer, to wine and also hard liquor. Went home to visit family and didn't drink for several days. 

I felt sick. Nausea, sometimes a feeling of weakness or almost pain in my joints, and fatigue as well as restlessness at the same time. 

I thought I'd caught a cold, so I drank a lot of tea, which usually helps. But it didn't help in this scenario. I continued to feel sick until last night when I had wine and some shots with friends. I was worried at first that it would make me more sick. But miraculously, I felt better. And even today, it's almost as if I never was ill.

I don't feel dependent on alcohol, I would know if I was addicted - I've been smoking for 7 years. I will also be volunteering on a sailboat in Norway for 2 months, cleaning up plastic trash and nets from the sea and coastline; so there will not be much drinking anyway, good for me.

Anyway, I'm not too concerned about alcoholism per se, I was just wondering if I was truly suffering from withrawal symptoms. That would be a first for me.

Thanks guys!"
alcoholism,Melanoma_man,2020/2/6,"I use to be a problem drinker my self. But this post is regarding my mum who has been a alcoholic since I can remember. I¡¯ve never seen alcohol affect anyone quite like it  does with my mum. She literally transforms into a vicious crone, and I imagine if she was born the 17th or 16th centuries, she would of been accused of being a witch and burnt alive at the stake..

My mum is a very abusive alcoholic. During my childhood she use to beat me black and blue and my younger brother nearly died as a baby due to neglect. 

At one time she left the grill on and left the house to get more alcohol and the house filled up with black smoke and me and my brother could of died, if it wasn¡¯t for a neighbour kicking the door in and rescuing us.
One time me and my brother was in my step dads car (my brother is my half brother) and she was drunk as usual and crashed into another car.. luckily no one was hurt.

My childhood memories was filled with an empty stomach due to neglect and the beatings.

After failing to pick me up from school on time and the new head teacher saw for himself how drunk she was and her being abusive to the other teachers. Social services got involved and finally put me and my brother info care.

She still drinks to this day. Just last year she caused a fire by falling asleep with a cigarette and one of her dogs died in the fire.

She¡¯s a mess.

She¡¯s never worked either since I can remember and just parasitises from the state, family, neighbours and myself.  I use to transfer her money but stopped enabling her.

Since I¡¯ve had cancer she still tries to scrounge money from me and got jealous of other family members supporting me and not her. 

I still work even tho I have cancer and she complains about being destitute and that she¡¯s the victim..

My mum is beyond help. She really is. My brother has cut her off completely and so has most of her siblings.

alcoholism,owahy,2020/2/20,"Looking for hope for friend Hi all
First post, sorry if this is a mess or doesn¡¯t make sense my 32yr old friend (and ex) has finally submitted to hospital after six years of me trying 


He is an alcoholic (1L vodka a day most likely)
 (I am in long term recovery 5 yrs hi ???? ) 
and has been living in another country for the last 8 years (this is why I can¡¯t be there and my only information is from his messages &amp; he tends to try and skew the facts to make it not alcohol related- he is in severe denial) 

I have driven myself insane reading medical journals and I need to know if any of you can take these facts and make sense, I need to know where we¡¯re at as he is not honest and I think I need to book a flight tomorrow (or maybe I am just overreacting like he says...) 

(My assumption is late stage liver cirrhosis and possible failure ) but he is reticent to let me speak this and just tells me the doctors have diagnosed it as ¡®spleen and liver infection not alcohol related at all but the alcohol doesn¡¯t help!¡±



The facts 

Huge ascites on stomach - they diagnosed this visibly and then x ray but it hurt him a lot to lay on his back 


He has been vomiting blood and the other end for over a year and excretes puss 
Nose bleeds, shaking, stomach pain and difficult breathing and walking (although he has maintained his desk job throughout this until hospital - but barely) 

Severe Vitamin K deficiency &amp; malnutrition (he has not been able to eat or keep down much food for at least a year but the last time I saw him in person five years ago he barely ate once in seven days) 

Severely swollen liver and spleen
Pushing on his lungs and other organs 

Blood isn¡¯t clotting and his muscles are wasted and his is severely underweight apart from the huge belly 

And the newest news ¡°the doctors have said that my veins have created their own route to bypass my liver¡± 



He is an unreliable narrator and it hard being emotionally invested as he squeezes the few facts he gives me in between masses of dialogue which I know in my heart is bull - 
He is telling me the doctors say he will need to ¡°cut down¡± bit not damaged enough to have to stop ...? Really?! 

He did not want Valium substitute while in hospital and said he doesn¡¯t need a drink but they have forced this upon him (I am very glad they are doing this so as not to cold turkey him) 

The doctors have now performed blood tests and CT and ultrasound too and hoping to drain the fluid which is way more than they thought 

(He doesn¡¯t like to give me information that backs up a diagnosis of anything alcohol related and just deflects so I hope I¡¯m not crazy in thinking his litre a day of vodka and these symptoms match up with the probable sad truth) 



Has anyone got experience of a close person or themselves having had these symptoms and possibly what they mean- 
I¡¯m being gaslit out of all proportion by my in denial &amp; addicted friend whom I dearly love and hope anyone could shed some light on these things and what they might mean for him as I sadly cannot fly out to be there nor does he want anyone to 



Not seeking medical advice obviously, he is in a safe place and with good doctors, I just need to know to be honest if this situation has any hope (from any experience) I just need help with trusting these facts and navigating the bull- so I know if I need to fly out ASAP"

this is my first post in this community and it's not easy for me to write about this topic. I don't even know if I should be worried about it, but something doesn't feel right about my alcohol consumption. 

For context, I'm a 27 years old Italian woman, I've struggled with depression and suicidal ideation, even though I have a good job and a generally ""normal"" life. But I'm not so sure about what's healthy and not, anymore. 

In the last year I've started drinking alone, just one beer during happy hours, but in the last two months I started feeling like that one beer has become, like, necessary to get relaxed after a workday. I usually eat something while drinking, but as you can imagine bars don't have much healthy food during happy hours - so I usually end up binge eating french fries and junk food while drinking. And I've started feeling like also the food is a way to release some stress. Sometimes I find myself looking forward to that beer and the junk food (the food plays an important role I'm sure) like that is the most pleasurable moment of the day.  

In social settings I don't drink much and I feel ashamed of my ""lonely beers"". 

Also, I'm going off my antidepressants this month (this has been programmed with my psychiatrist) and I'm having some panic attacks due to the lower antidepressant dose, and yesterday when I had anxiety I felt the need to ""drink it away"". I didn't, but now I'm scared. 

I'm terrified, I haven't told anyone about this and I don't know what to do. Maybe I'm just dramatizing a normal drinking habit?

I'm a basically a nihilist and a sociopath. Well a more controlled sociopath because I don't have anger issues. However, caring for people and things in general is just absolutely foreign. Other than entertainment, life has no point. With that in mind, drugs and alcohol are a go-to with alcohol being the default due to accessibility. 

I'll get sober and healthy every once in awhile and just get bored and go back to being drunk. Suicide is a constant option because, well, why not?

I'm 26 and married (for now at least). 

I've been dating my now wife for about 10 years now. About a year ago I became addicted to alcohol. A short time after that I started compulsively lying about everything, big or small. From getting promotions at work, to being in a car accident, to what time I would come home from work. 

I recently got discovered, and naturally my wife is furious. 

I'm going to my first AA meeting later tonight, and I'm starting therapy that specializes in sexual abuse later this week. 

The worst part is that I feel very little emotion or remorse. I don't know if I'm in shock or just apathetic and depressed. But it's really hard for me feel right now. And that makes me want to drink again and end my massive 12 hours of sobriety already.

I know how hard it can be, and its not as simple as going to the ER and saying I need help, sometimes help is hard to get. I've been through it.

Please dont give up on yourself, and if you need some guidance, or even someone to listen, I gotchu.

alcoholism,Silpelit19,2020/2/21,Someone I know checked into rehab They took medical leave from work (1 month). could they be at risk of losing their job because of this?
alcoholism,breathing_dead,2020/3/13,"Not sure how I (20F) should leave alcoholic BF (30M) who has a violent history. Been together 18 months, living together 14. Worried about welfare of pets. TLDR;      Not sure about best way to leave alcoholic BF, worried about our shared pets welfare, advice from others who have been in his position? 

How to break up with alcoholic bf with violent history? 

I¡¯ve decided I¡¯m leaving my emotionally manipulative bf. He¡¯s ten years my senior and we¡¯ve been together 18 months or so. He is all I could ask for when sober (or if he¡¯s just had a few) but when he¡¯s drunk his personality changes. 

When we got together he was living with his dad with no job, no license and no way to function as an adult, having just been released after a four year jail stint. I got him a job soon after and have driven him to work every day since. I got him his permit, but he failed his test, so I¡¯m still driving. He has another booked, but has not made any effort to book lessons or drive with his dad. 

I have been unemployed myself for much of the time, living on benefits while studying. I¡¯ve worked a few temp jobs but otherwise he¡¯s provided for me (except for when we first got together). He is a good provider. 

The underlying issue is his drinking. His family are multigenerational alcoholics. His father frequently drives drunk, and he¡¯s been in trouble years before for driving without a license and drunk driving / drug driving. We have three cats, two of which are his (we have adopted them since we got together). He has thrown things and accused me of cheating when drunk, he¡¯s threatened to kill me and my family, he¡¯s gotten me fired because of his behaviour at work functions. He¡¯s damaged relationships between my family, friends and myself, and I¡¯m constantly apologising on his behalf. 

I have gotten a house with a friend, and can move in shortly. But I¡¯m not sure how to go about leaving. 

I am worried he¡¯ll immediately turn back to drugs, smash the house up and hurt the two cats I can¡¯t legally take with me (this is my biggest fear, other than him hurting me). He is extremely dangerous and can and will hurt people if he¡¯s angry enough. 

I don¡¯t know if I should take my cat and go, or if I should just take them all regardless and leave. I¡¯m still responsible for taking him to and from work, so leaving during the day is tricky. I also don¡¯t know wether trying to talk it out with him will end in me getting hurt. I don¡¯t want to leave my pets to be abandoned by him if he returns to jail or drug use (meth), but on the off chance he keeps himself together and finds a way to work, he deserves to have his cats as company. 

My real estate agent is letting me break lease early under the DV act and is very supportive so I don¡¯t have to worry about that, thankfully. 

I know it¡¯s long, but what would you guys do in this situation? Any advice would be so helpful. 

Thank you all."

I have a great G.P.A. and rarely miss class. I have accepted a dream job starting as soon as this pandemic is over and I wonder if I should seek help during this period before starting. I drink 3-5 nights a week and am fairly physically active. I hope this finds someone in a similar scenario and am intrigued to read the responses.
alcoholism,HardlyBoi,2020/4/18,"Made a plan to quit drinking. Terrified of the withdrawls. Long time lurker first time posting. So im not sure what to put here.. Ive messed up my life alot with alcohol in the past and paid the price but never really learned anything except how to better hide my drinking.

With everything going on and where I am in life I need to change cause the world is going to be so different I can't see a way forward if I dont stop drinking. Ive never really made any significant changes to better improve my future only reactive to stay where I am in life.

Been unemployed for 2 months and lost my last job due to drinking. Before that I was a chef for 12 years and able to maintain jobs while drinking for years on end. Left my last kitchen job of 8 years in July of last year in an attempt to remove myself from the culture and quit drinking after I got my second OWI.

I didnt stick with it tho and kept up with my drinking. Now I'm almost flat broke. Up to my eyes in debt and fines and unemployed with no prospects for the future because of my drinking fucking up my life. Been going to bed blacking out nightly and waking up everyday for the past month in quarantine and slamming a coffee cup full of rum to stave off the shakes so I can hold my fork steady while I try to eat breakfast.

I WILL WAKE UP MONDAY and break that cycle. Must make it happen for myself this time and move forward in life before I'm homeless. I'm terrified I'll have such bad withdrawl I may have to go to the hospital. I'm just reaching out anonymously cause I dont wana stress out my family or SO anymore and feel so ashamed that the suicidal thoughts come rushing back."

I'm more so seeking advice from someone on his end of things so I can figure out how to approach him without it turning into a fight. 

How were you emotionally reached when a loved one needed to share their concerns about your drinking? 

I'm considering taking a ""break"" with the condition that if he doesn't take this seriously this time then I won't be coming back. (Though this scenario has happened multiple times without my full commitment either cause, y'kno, codependency)

My heart is so torn. I want my love for him to be unconditional. I can't help but feel terribly guilty to have to leave him over this when I want to be his support.. to be there to help him get through this and yet it seems like I can do nothing right.

He refuses to go to AA. But he also said that the way I approached him about going was really wrong.. so what is the best way to approach that conversation?? What was it that lead you to going to your first meeting? Is getting sober something someone can fully do on their own without AA meetings? Or does that mostly depend on the individuals will power/determination? I must admit I have a hard time wrapping my head around his thought process.  Really need some insight.

alcoholism,newuser-help,2020/3/29,"Stopped drinking a few days ago and am wondering if withdrawl symptoms are common I am 30 years old, and have been drinking a decent amount for 2-3 years (7-10+ drinks every day for the last year, same amount every two days for the previous 1-2 years).

I tried quitting a few times myself but it never really took. For about the past two weeks I've been feeling this sudden chest pain in the left of my chest.. only happens a few times a day and only lasts a few moments. Four days ago, I binged and in the morning had the chest pain again so I decided to try and stop drinking (attributed the chest pain to that).

First days' symptoms were really bad (no sleep, sweating, weird heart rythems). Next two days weren't actually that bad.. some headaches and lots of brain fog, but other than that nothing much.

I'm on day 4 now, and about an hour ago just had some kind of anxiety attack or something... huge brain fog, very heavy feeling heart beat, a bit of chest pain (same spot I've been having it for 2+ weeks). It seems to have subsided now, so now all I seem to have is the brain fog... 

Is it possible all symptoms are related to alcohol &amp; withdrawl? Sweating and brain fog are symptoms I had before (in previous attempts to stop drinking).. is it possible none of the other symptoms are related to alcohol &amp; withdrawl? I can't really go to any clinic or doctor, thanks to all this coronavirus stuff, so online resources are all I can turn to.

So I guess my questions are:

\- Is it common to have more severe symptoms on day 4 (or 5)? Rather than in only the first 72 hours?

\- I read online that brain fog can last weeks or even months.. does anyone have any experience/advice regarding this?"

alcoholism,MargitSlachta,2020/3/15,"Thinking of Giving My Mother an Ultimatum. Need Advice. My mother recently relapsed after almost a year sober. I spent Christmas with her and my sister, and I really regretted it. I had a horrible time. She's an angry drunk, and she says such hurtful, hateful things when she's drinking.

She's had a problem with alcohol, to a greater or lesser extent, my whole life, It's always been something of a struggle, but it's only after almost a year of being able to have a relationship with my mother as she could be - kinder, less erratic, and most importantly, HAPPIER - that I really feel that I'm not capable of putting up with it any more. It's just too exhausting.

I know my mum is sorry and ashamed, but that doesn't really help. I haven't seen her since Christmas. Tonight she messaged me, inviting me to stay with her while my workplace is shut due to the coronavirus, and I told her, truthfully, that I have other plans. But I can't keep putting off the decision forever. I don't live far away. And what I really wanted to say to her was, ""I'm won't set foot in that house if you're going to be drinking.""

Is that a bad idea? Will it help or hinder her addiction? Complicating the matter is that my mother refuses to use the ""A"" word, even as she acknowledges that she needs to quit drinking. Alcoholics are people who can't hold down a job and who collapse in pools of their own vomit behind seedy bars at 3 o'clock in the morning. Not hard-working middle-class people like her. So I don't know if an ultimatum will only serve to make her dig her heels in.

alcoholism,SearchingF0RAnswers,2020/2/25,"Have any of you gone to rehab? How did you afford it? I'm getting so discouraged. I've been trying and working on stopping for like 18 months now. But I keep failing. And I'm so tired. 

I mostly do ok, make it 3, 4, 5 months without anything, keep my appointments, take my antabuse, get my shot every month, and then... something different triggers me every time. I get overwhelmed with life, or relationships, or family, get depressed, anxious.... something and I cant fight it. I can push it away for a week or two, but eventually I still end up slipping. 

I'm a week sober, again, for the umpteenth time, and I really am motivated to never, ever touch the stuff again, but this isnt the first time I've ever been this motivated, but this is the first time that I'm thinking maybe I need more help. 

I've been looking into inpatient programs in my area, but my problem is I lost my job after my last relapse (before this one), and I dont have private health insurance anymore. My credit is garbage, and I dont have the money for self pay. Medicaid doesn't cover inpatient care, just outpatient and detox, which I've been doing, I've done, and I need more. But $15,000+ for a 30 day program is astronomical. 

I've called everyone I can think of. State funded rehab is on a minimum 6 month waitlist, most of the private places only have like 5 grant/scholarship beds, and they're on multiple waitlists.

I've called literally everyone, up to and including different charities (To write love on her arms, 10000 beds, etc) and I cannot figure out how anyone manages to afford this. It's getting so discouraging and I dont know where else to turn. I've called literally every rehab within a 100 mile radius of me, and I dont want to go further than that because I'd like my daughter to be able to visit me.

Help! Anyone know of any other grants, charities, or places I can turn? I feel like I've exhausted all my options, and it really sucks that I want help, NEED help, and desperate for help, and am being told ""maybe in 6 months."" This shit is ruining my life, and I seriously want to be done."

I may occasionally have a beer when chilling alone but don¡¯t feel the urge to have more after. I can even go periods of weeks without a drink. My issue is whenever I hang out with friends and have a drink I can¡¯t stop. I plan on having one or two and end up having 15 drinks. Every time I drink socially I end up hammered. I keep my composure very well, and never seem shitfaced. Most people say I didn¡¯t seem that drunk the next day even after 15 drinks in, knowing I was pretty fucked up. I can and have gone up to 3-4 weeks without one drink. But once I have one drink socially I get absolutely fucked, then start doing it more often. I was off work for holidays for 2.5 weeks, and would say I drank around 14 of the 18 days as I was hanging with a lot of friends, and every time was with friends I got absolutely shitfaced (probs had 150-200 drinks over those couple weeks). I came back home from the holidays and said I¡¯m done binge drinking for a month as my body felt like it was shutting down. After getting home (different town then where I was for holidays), my buddy I hadn¡¯t seen in a while invited me out tonight and I thought why not. I told him I¡¯d have a couple drinks max as I need to work tomoro to catch up on stuff. I ended up drinking 15+ drinks, ended up at the casino to keep the night going, and am now at home awake past 6am. It¡¯s almost like I lose control after the first couple drinks and can¡¯t stop, and it only happens when with other people. I can control it when alone but when with others I can¡¯t stop. When out with others, I always tell myself I will only have a couple drinks then have at least 10. It is especially an issue at work events as I work in finance and people drink often. Whenever we go out for a social event I try to limit myself to a few drinks as don¡¯t want to do anything embarrassing around work colleagues and end up having like 10-15 drinks every time.

I've been living abroad for the last 4 years so I haven't kept in super close touch with my family.  I moved back to the US and I've been staying with my father for the last 5 months. 

It's really disappointing to see how dependent on alcohol he's become.  I don't think his alcoholism is as severe as a lot of the cases I read on here. But for him, he is drinking beer every day when the sun goes down. Literally he cannot skip a day. I would guess he's probably drinking 7-8 coors lights every day and chain smoking while he's drinking. 

I think he's really depressed. I've tried to take him aside and explain to him my feelings, and he'll admit he should make a change, but I think he simply has no desire to change.

From my perspective he's wasting his life drinking so much... Damaging his health and giving up so many life activities that could be enjoyable for him that he doesn't pursue because he's medicating himself with alcohol. I think the underlying issue is that he's depressed, he doesn't have many good hobbies or close friends. Just works and looks forward to drinking at night.

Drank every night for the past couple weeks to calm me the fuck down with layoffs happening and virus and whatnot. I do this once in a while, since drinking every night makes me feel great in the morning, but mostly just drink socially.

Yesterday woke up with pins and needles sensation in the fingers, toes, and in the hands. That was the first morning where I had not drunk the prior night, as the day prior I woke up and found I had broken my table and didn't remember shit and slept through a client call I was supposed to be in. That spooked me since it was the first time that had happened. So now I have a broken upside down table in the apartment. As well as broken glass but that's another story.

Anyways back to the point. Pins and needles in hands feet and fingers and toes. Fingertips feel raw, like they were burned. Maybe they were, who knows. Headaches, usually don't get these.. . Is this kindling? My paranoid mind was so freaked out it was neuropathy but frankly I do not have the history of heavy drinking that makes that outcome possible, to my knowledge.

That doesn't stop me from freaking the fuck out and ordering B vitamins. Help me understand his situation and find calm and/or purpose. I hope you enjoyed the tale of how I am one deeply dysfunctional motherfucker. Thank you.

Edit: Actually other than in perhaps a couple locations, it may be more accurate to describe the sensation as tingling rather than pins and needles. A little uncomfortable and it doesn't stop, but, not exactly ""painful"" I'd say"

He says it runs in the family but everyone else has told me that he is the only one. We have tried several times to get him to stop drinking, but he refuses to do it. He acknowledges that he has a problem, he even calls himself a drunk but he doesn't care who he affects or what repercussions his actions have. We aren't allowed to attend most family functions anymore because he makes everyone uncomfortable. Most of the bars he will go to will only be for a few months at a time, because he drinks to the point where they have to cut him off every night. Not only that but he may possibly be the most racist and inconsiderate person I know. He speaks his mind freely and causes problems wherever he goes.

Been back in the house for two months and this is my worst blackout there by far. After my parents went to sleep, I kept drinking. It culminated in me stripping my clothes off and urinating on the kitchen floor before going to bed. Something that wasn't a first in my apartment but definitely a first being back at home. My dad was the first one up and found my clothes lying next to the puddle of piss. I couldn't even look at him this morning when he told me. I can't shake how disgusted I am with myself and never want to feel this way again.

I self medicated with Alcohol as I had social anxiety disorder. It was impossible for me to attend college without having a shot of whiskey. I went into depression &amp; I was addicted by then. I was good at academics, had so many career ambitions. Alcohol has just ruined everything , be it my health, my relationships , career everything. My memory has become so weak that I forget what I ate in the morning by dinner.

Alcohol has become a necessary evil &amp; I feel like this evil I was feeding, is now feeding on me &amp; won't stop till it kills me.

alcoholism,MaiaPapaya33,2020/4/19,"Recovery / Recovered ? TLDR; is saying you¡¯re ¡°recovered¡± and still drinking recreationally a thing? My boyfriend says he¡¯s in total control and doesn¡¯t need recovery. 


My boyfriend of 2 months identifies as a recovered alcoholic, as in he doesn¡¯t need recovery, because he is fully in control. He did identify himself as an alcoholic who used to spend days at a time drunk and could get aggressive back when he was in the military. He says he realized he hated how he felt and how he was living and decided to never get to that place again and since then he has control. 

He says he¡¯s always had a high tolerance (he started drinking when he was 12) and so now he doesn¡¯t drink to get drunk, but he drinks to relax like when he¡¯s socially anxious or just for the taste. He says he needs about 6 drinks to start feeling it. So he does drink more than the average 25 year old maybe but it barely effects him. 

He feels incredibly invalidated if I don¡¯t use the word ¡®recovered¡¯ to refer to him. He got really explosive the first time I told him that I was very open to accepting that was his reality and that he did feel in control, and that my prior understanding of that feeling of control was called recovery which is experienced in many ways. 

I know there¡¯s a lot of different ways of experiencing alcoholism and I¡¯ve heard that there are some people in AA for example who leave and say they are recovered. 

My question is, is Recovered a thing? How can I beat validate him in his experience? Or is it objectively invalid as some of my alcoholic friends would say? Very open to any and all answers."

I have this female friend who I met a few months ago. We became fast friends, super close and sharing deeply personal thoughts together. I always had a small crush on her, however, and I fucked it up so badly that she blocked me and texted me telling me to never speak to her again. Yep, it was that bad.

I expressed my feelings for her one time and she said she saw me as a wonderful friend but didn't have romantic feelings for me. I decided to continue trying to be friends because I genuinely did like spending time with her. We were able to go back to our normal friendship and it didn't seem like she minded at all.

But then I guess two nights ago I got really drunk, and on Instagram I saw her hanging out with another guy friend. I guess I got jealous and started posting to my Story about how annoyed I was, she demands my attention all the time but doesn't like me, yada yada. I also tried facetime calling her a bunch even though she was declining them.

Anyway I deleted the message threads out of embarrassment without reading them, but she wants nothing to do with me ever again and I'm really sad about it. A really great friendship that meant a lot to me, gone after one night. She was who I would always confide in when I was sad, or happy, or whatever ¡ª now i feel so alone. I would pay so much money to be able to take that night back.

alcoholism,duchesstina88,2020/2/29,"Sober but no social life? Hey, I have posted here before and I was really thankful of the support this subreddit gave me. It was super tough but I exercised severe self control and have been completely sober for 2+months now. In the past 4 months, I only had in total 2 drinks for special occasions(1 drink each). The only way I could achieve this is by avoiding alcohol related scenarios altogether.  Stopped going to weekend parties, work events, birthdays etc. No matter what my friends plan, it somehow always ends up with liquor. Also the peer pressure is super painful ( this one time, I secretly told the bartender that I am a month pregnant so that he serves me water all night. Which he was very understanding about). Now, most of my friends don't call me as often and the remaining I avoid owing to their partying. Which is leading to a very non existent social life for me. I am alone most weekends now doing pretty much nothing. Not sure how to deal with this.  I really don't wish to come out as an alcoholic in front of family and friends.

She's almost 30, 90lbs soaking wet, is on trokendi for migraines, sometimes eats sometimes doesn't, and has a lot of depression and anxiety. She has been liquor-free for a year.

When she was 18, she could drink 1.5 Liters of vodka straight in one evening. Blackout drunkenness was the norm, from what she told me. She quit liquor a year ago after leaving a dude who was abusive when drunk. 

Last night she took a single shot of vodka, and experienced nothing short of euphoria. She was instantly drunk - I heard the change on the phone as we spoke. She described feeling like she's in the clouds, floating, and peaceful.

Tonight she took a shot while texting me about depression. The same euphoria came back. But she's also seeing rainbow everything when she closes her eyes, and has random childhood music in the background every time she closes her eyes.

I admire y¡¯alls strength in finding sobriety and it gives me hope for my fianc¨¦ when I thought hope was useless. I (23f) have been with my fianc¨¦ (40m) for 3 years, engaged for 1. Our wedding is 1.5 months away and I am starting to panic. We have gone through so many ups and down with his awful binge weeks and somewhat normal sober weeks. I know you can¡¯t make someone want to be sober but I really don¡¯t know what his breaking point will be. He has had loved ones die from drunk drivers, a dui that he feared would cost him his job, countless relationships ended over alcohol, and I think he knows I¡¯m hanging on by a thread, yet he continues to chose alcohol. I try not to take it personally because I know it¡¯s an addiction and that makes his way of thinking totally warped, but it¡¯s hard not to when he is completely emotionally abusive when he is drinking. From what I have heard from family he has had a problem with alcohol since college. Obviously with our age gap, he was my first ¡°adult¡± relationship and because he is older I thought this is just how much adults drink until I realized it was everyday he was completely wasted even before I would come over, and when I was there he would always try to get me wasted as well. He is unable To have a single drink without getting carried away and unable to drink without becoming completely aggressive and argumentative with anyone he talks to. No matter how ridiculous it is, he will find something to argue about and try to blame everything on you. He has tried aa, counseling, antibuse(have they quit making this?), but of course he didn¡¯t take it seriously because he wasn¡¯t ready. The longest I have seen him sober was one month and when he relapsed, around his 5th binge, he was saying he needed to get help and complaining that he is going to have to go back to his sober app and start it all over, as if he believed he was technically sober during those binges? I¡¯m afraid he will never be sober and our marriage will end if it even has a chance to begin. I don¡¯t know what to do or say. What made you realize you need to quit drinking?

It ruined my relationship and after she broke it off (completely understandable) I went through 2 months of being black out drunk 4+ times a week sneaking alcohol into the house so my friends / family didn't know how much I was drinking. Then one day I woke up and realised I'm not the person I went to be when I'm drink. I'm toxic and hurt the people I care about. It saddens me that I had to lose someone so important to me out of my life for me to realise this but with every day passing it gets easier not to use alcohol to solve my emotions. I'm so proud of myself for fixing this in me and I never want to drink again. Ive started being able to be around drinking and be fine with a soft drink.

alcoholism,ouestdelalune,2020/2/20,"Am I an alcoholic? So today at around 9pm when I had 2 crates of beer delivered to my house after already drinking 5 magnums my son called me an alcoholic. He¡¯s 11. I drink a lot. 
I work in a professional job. I don¡¯t drink days before I work generally but can have a lot of days off sometimes and will drink maybe 1-3 days a week depending on my shifts. He said I couldn¡¯t go a week without drinking. That might be true. I can¡¯t remember a time in the past 10 years that I¡¯ve gone a week without drinking. It¡¯s worse when I¡¯m on holiday and it wouldn¡¯t be abnormal to drink every day when I¡¯m off. Not always to excess but an average would be around 15 units a night. I¡¯d be functional the next day after that. I could drink a lot more sometimes. It is also usual to have days off. Sometimes up to 6 consecutive days off drinking. 
I have historically got up and started drinking early in the morning but usually only on party weekends etc when I¡¯m going a bit mad and everyone else is. I also come from a culture where excessive drinking is pretty much the norm. Everyone does it, everyone talks about it, no one ever says, your drinking is out of control etc. It¡¯s basically a running joke that we¡¯d all drink vodka through the eye. We¡¯d have a gin in work at 9am if it were acceptable. 
I often crave a drink, particularly after difficult shifts or hard days. I feel relaxed when I drink but the day after I¡¯m usually tired, irritable and ineffective. 
I¡¯ve put on a lot of weight in the past few years, my house is a riot, I feel like my brain doesn¡¯t work like it should and I¡¯m permanently tired. 
As a teenager I had pretty serious mental health problems and alcohol was always a coping mechanism. It probably has been since I was around 13. I¡¯m early 30s now. 
My only abstinent phase was when pregnant and breastfeeding and in the first few years of my sons life I probably only drank a few times a year.
I have thought for a while that my drinking is starting to affect my life in negative ways. Specifically I am not as efficient as I used to be, I am not as cognitively efficient either. I am tired all the time and have no energy to do anything. The things I do do, I do in a fugue of sleepiness or hungoverness generally. 
My anxiety has also been pretty terrible in the past year. It¡¯s difficult to tell whether my job caused the escalation in my anxiety or my drinking and which caused the exacerbation of the other. 
I did see my GP around October last year and was signed off for stress and anxiety. They offered antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication which I declined as I have tried a number before and feel that they have been ineffective. I have tried a number of antidepressants and also found that when I came off beta blockers I was getting horrendous migraines. At that time in October I had symptoms close to PTSD due to an extremely stressful work environment. I couldn¡¯t leave the house, everything made my heart pound. I suppose I¡¯m a little better now but often things like going to the supermarket are just such a huge and scary task. 
I find it difficult to pick apart everything that¡¯s going on in my life. I think I probably do have a problem with alcohol, that being a psychological one that goes back  20 years. I don¡¯t know how to start addressing that. 
I have considered AA but have actually attended AA meetings before with friends and personally would describe them as a scary cult. I know that they help so many people and do so much excellent work and fill the gaps in the health service but I just don¡¯t know that AA will ever be for me. I don¡¯t believe in a God, I don¡¯t believe in a higher power, I can¡¯t commit to all that mantra stuff. Maybe I should go via health services for help? I just don¡¯t know. Maybe I don¡¯t really have a problem and I¡¯m just being melodramatic?
Any insight much appreciated."

alcoholism,After-Hope,2020/1/15,"my girlfriend is an alcoholic and I just don't know what to do I just wanted someone to talk to. I feel so alone in real life because I don't have anyone who would understand. I am so heartbroken and tired. Is there such a thing as AA for people whose loved ones are alcoholics? I might need to go for that, if it exists. I am starting to feel like I desperately need help myself.

My girlfriend is just.. a horrible person when she drinks. She becomes this really angry, cruel, irrational, violent person. She says terrible things to me, which I can't help but feel are her honest feelings that she's only letting out when she's been drinking. It's awful because she's so different when she's sober. It makes me feel like I'm dating two people. Or rather, it makes me feel like I need to figure out which one is the real personality, if that makes sense. 

I used to think that the sober her was the real personality, but recently I've been losing hope. I've been feeling like she's actually been Mr Hyde all along. The reason why I've been losing hope is because we had a big fight about her drinking some time back, and she agreed that it was ruining her life and that she had to quit. I told her it was okay to do it at her own pace and that all I wanted was transparency. Meaning that I wanted to know how often she was drinking, and how much. Because I was quite sure that she drank much more often than I knew about, and I felt like it would help if a) she could be more conscious of when and how much she was drinking, and b) if I could get a better sense for how bad her problem was. 

She's tried quitting before, but not very seriously. She's supposed to be going to AA now, but obviously I don't know if/when she's actually going. I don't really want to go into it because I'm so worn down already, but suffice to say that recently I keep accidentally-or-otherwise discovering that she's been drinking but didn't tell me/outright lied about it. Or otherwise meaning that she appeared obviously drunk, so I questioned her until she admitted that she'd been drinking. That's one thing that's really awful by the way. The way she'll be so obviously drunk but refuse to admit that she's been drinking. It makes me feel like, if she's willing to lie about this stuff, and in fact if that's her first instinct, then what else has she been lying about? It makes me feel... bad, as well, almost ashamed, because I feel like I've allowed myself to be abused. Or that I've been stupid for believing in her all this time.

I don't really know what to do. Since not drinking is self-reported, I guess part of me wonders if she'll just lie at AA like she's been lying to me. At one point she was visibly drunk, and she insisted to me that she was going to receive her one month chip in a few days. I don't know if she genuinely had been sober for the rest of the month before that, but it's pretty obvious that she wouldn't qualify for a one month chip now. Would an alcoholic lie just to get the chip? Would AA find out? I don't see how AA could find out unless they admitted to it, or they came into a meeting drunk. 

I don't know what to do. I really don't. If any of you have any advice or words of comfort, I would really appreciate it."

alcoholism,throwaway5t0p,2020/1/18,"How to help a friend I used to binge drink with?  

Me and my friend used to binge drink together years ago in our early 20's. Since then I seemed to learn moderation, and moved on/moved to another state 500 miles away. We still talk on the phone several times a week so were still pretty close.

My friend still lives at home with his parents. His dads an alcoholic too so I think they're far to desensitized to the whole thing. He will go through short 3 day burst of not drinking(probably cause hes broke) and then go right back to drinking 7+% IPAs. Like multiple days in a row. Like drinking through hangovers which blows my mind. Getting wasted and driving all over town.

I'm afraid he's going to get a DUI or diabetes or something since hes a heavier dude, and his dad has that as well. Almost more than that I'm afraid that the drinking is emotionally stunting him, and hes never going to grow up, and move out of his parents house, and get a girlfriend. Generally just never mature into an adult.

How can I bring my concerns up to him without seeming like I'm judging him, or how can i help give him the tools to help himself. Any time I seem to approach the topic he starts to get really defensive. So I just back off, but I think It's getting to a point that I need to do something. Any advice?"

alcoholism,sizz_lor,2020/2/9,"Reservations about being an alcoholic/addict. So I use to be all about getting messed up with alcohol and pills mostly. I went to treatment, then I went to AA regularly for about a year. I got bored of AA and have since been drinking occasionally. As of right now I drink socially about once a week. I don¡¯t do any illegal drugs and my mind is not hyper focused on getting messed up all the time. The problem I always had with AA is that you are either an alcoholic or you are not. There is no grey area with these people. I think I truly lay somewhere inbetween, which makes me not a true alcoholic. My problem with drugs was solved by a combination of relocating myself, treatment, and meetings. If you address the things wrong in your life that make you want to use, you will lose that urge to use. I don¡¯t think I¡¯m a true alcy/addict"
alcoholism,Larry409,2020/1/25,"34, and think I have a problem. I quit drinking when I turned 22 because I got a wicked bacterial infection in my stomach from sushi. I couldn¡¯t eat, definitely couldn¡¯t drink, lost a BUNCH of weight..etc etc I didn¡¯t touch alcohol again until I was 29. 

Well, I¡¯m 34 now, and I¡¯ve been drinking a pint of liquor a day for five years (sometimes more, sometime less. Depends on the day.) 
I just fell into this routine of drinking every day after my dinner had settled, and now I¡¯m wondering if I could be physically addicted at this point. 
My friends and family offer different opinions, with some saying ¡°you¡¯re an alcoholic¡±, while others maintain ¡°Much of the world drinks daily. Even Winston Churchill drank a quart a day¡±..etc 

My typical choice is vodka, chased with plenty of water. I don¡¯t do mixed drinks that often, and like to keep hydrated when I drink. I¡¯m just wondering if at this point I *do* have a problem, because the thing is, I don¡¯t want to give up my evening/night liquor, but I also don¡¯t want to suffer seizures or severe withdrawal symptoms if I decided to get completely sober. 

I¡¯m considering just reducing my intake each night until I can reach a better level of  consumption, as a pint (or more) each night is a bit much, if even taken slow with plenty of water.  

Any suggestions, comments, or advice is most welcome. Thnx, all."

addiction,scottsteinberg,2020/4/8,"How Heroin &amp; Heroin-Associated Cues Strengthen Memory Consolidation. Drug-Linked Cues Evoke Drug-Like Responses https://youtu.be/9EnEDJ4QMt0

Addictive drugs are said to often worsen memory, and anecdotal reports of drug-users with poor memory are abundant. But what if these reports are wrong? What if drugs of abuse can improve memory under particular circumstances? In this episode, Michael Wolter - Neuroscience PhD Candidate - joins us to discuss how heroin and other drugs of abuse (including cocaine &amp; nicotine) can enhance memory for events immediately preceding drug intake. This work has vast implications for the development of addiction, and for preventing relapse to addictive drugs. In fact, drug-linked experiences stored in the brain's long-term memory centres are believed to be largely responsible for relapse to drug seeking behaviour and drug abuse, even after long periods of successful abstinence.

Manuscript: Modulation of object memory consolidation by heroin and heroin-conditioned stimuli: Role of opioid and noradrenergic systems. Published in the journal European Neuropsychopharmacology: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32067860

Abstract
There is recent evidence that cocaine, nicotine, and their conditioned stimuli have the ability to enhance memory consolidation. The present study compared the effects of post-training heroin and of a heroin contextual conditioned stimulus (CS+) on consolidation of object recognition memory and investigated the roles of opioid and beta-adrenergic receptors in heroin/CS+ memory modulation by co-administering the respective antagonists, naltrexone (NTX) and propranolol (PRO). Three experiments were performed in male Sprague-Dawley rats demonstrating that immediate, but not delayed, post-sample exposure to heroin (0.3, 1 mg/kg), or exposure (30 min) to a contextual CS+ paired with 1 mg/kg heroin (5 pairings, each 120 min), equally enhanced object memory. Importantly, while the memory enhancing effects of 1 mg/kg heroin and of the contextual CS+ were not altered by post-training co-administration of 3 mg/kg naltrexone, they were blocked by post-training co-administration of 10 mg/kg propranolol. Taken together, these data suggest that a context paired with heroin shares the memory enhancing effect of heroin itself and that these unconditioned and conditioned drug stimuli may modulate memory through the activation of beta-noradrenergic receptors.

&amp;#x200B;

Description: 

The Nutty prof begins by saying this is the follow up to the previous PC on integrating shadow and he adds the concept of ¡°POTE¡± to his PATAP approach to addiction (as an analogy to help understand cravings at different levels).  He also reminds viewers of the Freudian concepts of Eros and Thanatos (Life and Death instincts) from a previous podcast. 

This leads him to talk about the process of attempting to ¡°reconcile¡± other ¡°opposites¡± besides ¡°Eros and Thanatos¡±, these include forward and back, up and down, light and dark, in and out, and he also discusses other ¡°metaphors¡± for ¡°movement¡± like ¡°circles¡± and ¡°spirals¡±.  He proceeds to discuss symbols and how he doesn¡¯t take them ¡°literally¡± and he mentions that he recently had a Tarot card reading.  

He focuses on the three cards he selected during the reading, the first was the ¡°World¡± card and it seems to deal with links to the community.  The second card was ¡°Enemies¡± and deals with conflict, he discusses a conflict with a former friend (without going into a lot of details) and how at one time he¡¯d had conflicts with his father but those issues seem resolved but he considers that conflict could also refer to the inner conflicts involved in confronting shadow/reconciling opposites.  He also shares a couple of dreams he had that seem to compliment the Tarot reading.   The most positive card was the third which suggested stresses are temporary (one needs to detach from them).  The nutty prof ends with a reference to the book ¡°Heart of Darkness¡± (adapted into ¡°Apocalypse Now¡±) saying his goal is to be the Sheen character who returns from the journey to darkness and not the Brando character who goes mad and he says he¡¯ll keep viewers posted.

addiction,muffinlover22,2020/1/7,"Therapist experience in treating substance use This is a paper I wrote from my experience as a therapist working in the field of substance abuse:

Addicts experience something breathtaking when they can stretch their vision of themselves from the immediate present back to the past that shaped them and forward to a future that¡¯s attainable and satisfying ¨C Marc Lewis
 
How do you convince someone that their ability to make decisions is compromised as a result of something in their brain that is influencing the determination of their decisions before they even make them? This phenomenon becomes more prevalent on a daily basis when working with those who are suffering with substance use disorders. The predicament arises in the fact that because individuals are conscious, they believe they are in complete control over the decisions that they make. These decisions that are made, to the individual, are grounded in reason and rational thinking that is aimed with their best interest in mind. Unfortunately, these decisions have the capacity for self-destruction because due to the troubled history that each person has encountered. Memory has an integral role in decisions. Memory utilizes the past to understand the present to anticipate the future. If an individual¡¯s past has had trauma and many forms of distress, their memory is going to ensure that their decisions are protective in nature. This means that decisions will be geared towards the avoidance of pain, avoidance of discomfort, the avoidance of stress, and ultimately, the avoidance of change. This is troubling because when exploring healthy life changes with someone, a therapist will encourage that individual to identify changes that can be made that will hopefully improve that person¡¯s quality of life. That is where the challenge arises. Ideally, someone can gain insight and harness motivation to change to make positive life adjustments. The thing is, this does not always work out because something stops that individual from drawing power from their insight and turning it into behaviors that are conducive to a new way of life. This leads to frustration, shame, guilt, and eventually depression as someone who has all of the desire to make changes, just cannot put it together to make a difference. One begins to learn that the unconscious mind often has a completely different agenda than the individual. One learns that there is comfort in the chaos because it is familiar, even to the point where the chaos leads to complete isolation, socially, physically, and emotionally.
?When looking at the benefits of using substances/alcohol, it cannot be ignored that the effects of the high, produce such a powerful feeling of safety and security. The high is a safe experience and no matter how much pain an individual encounters, the high is there to shield them from the full impact of the situation. It is impossible to isolate addiction to one singular event in time, however, different forms of trauma are the one trait that all of my clients have experienced. I have learned that addiction always begins with pain and always ends with pain. The high feels like that surge of warmth and protection that comes from the embrace of a loved one or the love that was missing for an individual who never had the opportunity to experience it. It is no surprise that opioids are the endorphins that are released in the human body when a mother is holding and begins to soothe her distressed infant. Unfortunately, the high turns on the user and the individual becomes even more trapped in walls of isolation that are reinforced by bricks of shame, fear, and despair, but this is still a state of being that is desired because life on life¡¯s terms is too overwhelming and unbearable. The frustrating part of addiction is the desperation to get clean when using, but also the desperation to get high when clean. Where does someone turn when stuck in this persistent state of hopeless of always knowing where they want to be, but never being where they are?
?The effects of the environment on the individual are impactful. Fortunately, this is something that can be utilized to foster change. I have heard that the goal of psychotherapy should always be security. This is a challenge in itself because if someone has grown up in a toxic environment with abuse or neglect, the body is going to not allow the individual to feel secure and thus change is ultimately prevented. I have seen and explored this problem through my work and through my own experience. The answer has to be connection. Connection to a person, who provides unconditional positive regard, like Carl Rogers emphasized. This person can be the therapist or another person, who can provide the stability and unwavering support that conveys the message that I am here with you no matter what your emotions and feelings tell you. The therapist/person has to show the individual through their personality and support, that they can be the safety net the person needs. This happens through sending cues of safety that help the other person start to turn off that flight or fight response system or the withdrawal system. This is not an easy process, but through consistent support, it can be accomplished. If an environment caused an individual to make decisions that are protective to adapt to that environment, an environment can also be fostered to illustrate to that person that they don¡¯t always have to protect themselves and that there is so much power in vulnerability. Through trust and support, a person can learn how to tell his or her body ¡°calm down, were not in danger,¡± and allow themselves to experience the freedoms that connection can offer. Through co-regulation (learning how to manage emotional states with someone else) with someone, a person can eventually learn self-regulation (self-soothe). They can learn that they can manage the pain that is inevitable in life. People will always experience pain in life, that is a reality. The growth starts when people lead that they don¡¯t have to face the pain alone. Through connections with other people, those suffering with substance use disorders can learn that they do not need use drugs to get their needs met because they can get those needs through other people, naturally. Change will always be hard, but through support change doesn¡¯t have to about suffering and can lead to new meaning."

Reading \[This guide\]([https://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/bzcha02.htm](https://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/bzcha02.htm)) published a few decades ago about withdrawing from benzodiazepines and saw an interesting tidbit:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*They say  that most smokers make 7 or 8 attempts before they finally give up cigarettes. The good news is that most long-term benzodiazepine users are successful after the first attempt.*

&amp;#x200B;

The author doesn't really provide a source for that but it made me curious about why some drugs might make relapse more likely when trying to quit. It's especially interesting to me given the danger of sudden benzo withdrawal compared to smoking. Maybe it's easier to measure gradually smaller doses when tapering off a benzo? I guess smoking smaller and smaller cigarettes is not really practical. Is it a property of the chemical that dictates the likelihood of discontinuation success, or just a matter of personality and mindset?"

addiction,battered_seoul,2020/4/13,"Opponent-Process Theory Conception of Withdrawal I've been reading about the opponent-process theory of addiction posited by Soloman and Corbit. 

If I understand it, a countervailing affective process B is generated in response to process A, the initial neural response to a stimulus such as a narcotic. 

The brain adapts to the stimulus and generates an increasingly strong opponent process as the nervous system seeks to impose transience on any sustained feeling that could peturb the brain's neutral state.

Withdrawal is this countervailing b process outlasting the drug's effect.

My question is; why isn't the state of withdrawal itself not counteracted naturally by the addicted subject's brain if it is so sensitive to peturbation? Surely, withdrawal could eventually be interpreted as a sustained negative peturbation of the base state?

addiction,billie-isis,2020/4/16,"The biggest regret of addiction Hey all, 
I thought I¡¯d just share my thoughts on how I¡¯m feeling in regards to my past addictions 
So I was essentially a drug addict since I was very young (started at twelve years of age) 
It first started smoking weed and drinking with my mates and over the years turned into basically every drug other than meth and heroin. I left school when I was fifteen and got a full time job and would work six days a week and would blow the whole pay check on a cocktail of drugs, this went on up until I was twenty years old and decided one day I¡¯ve had enough and quit everything that same day.
I¡¯ve been sober for a very long time but one thing I regret is going out with friends to have a good night and watch them pull out a bag of coke or mdma mid way through and see them enjoying themselves with no toxic history behind it and genuinely just have fun in the moment and wake up the next day with no thought of taking more for months knowing if that was me I¡¯d be calling my dealer the next morning for more. 
Sometimes I¡¯ll be visiting my brothers for dinner and a movie and they will pull out a joint to lighten up the mood and knowing I can¡¯t participate because one joint never stays to just one joint. 
Honestly all the money spent over the years all the moments in life I missed to do drugs all the relationships I ruined I got past but I genuinely wish i could just clear any memory of my previous addiction and be able to just take substance once a year just to have a good time but clearly that will never be the case. It feels great to be sober and actually have a savings account or be able to take things seriously and be taken seriously but every now and then it would be nice to just just roll up a joint put my feet up and just drift off for a few hours. 
Any way I¡¯d love any advice or others to share their experiences as it always helps to hear from others than are also in the same boat 
Cheers for reading

To give you a little background information, I grew up in a rough neighborhood, I was exposed to drugs from an early age.When I was a kid, around 6 or 7 me and my friends promised to each other that we won't ever do drugs (heroin in special as we saw what did to other older kids who would just nod out on the park benches where we would play) years later we started drinking then shortly after smoking weed and doing other hard drugs such as cocaine mdma ketamine acid xanax and meth. My biggest problem is weed, I smoked it every day for 3 years until 2 months ago when I stopped leaving my house because of the covid-19 situation but I am convinced that once this is over I ll get back on my shit, maybe even earlier as yesterday I tried to sneak out of the house to go pop ecstasy but my father caught me. I am ashamed of myself for risking my family's health by going to hang out with a bunch of my friends that I know for sure don't respect the social distancing and some of them present many symptoms of the virus. I tried many times to quit smoking weed and doing other drugs but as soon as I am near them or even think about them is like I flip a switch and is the only thing on my mind, I deceive myself that it's not that big of a deal and that I will stop someday. I am also addicted to the lifestyle, the streets and the connections I built over the time and I think that is even a worse addiction than my substance one as I feel that the kind of people I am surrounded by are the only ones who accept me and can relate to my problems , plus the fact that most of them I know since we were kids and we always had each others backs. I wish some day I will do things that are good for me, as I know that true happiness doesn't come from outside stimuli but rather from things you build for yourself, and that often isn't easy and requires will power  consistency and discipline, but for now I lack that, I feel like my brain is wired only for instant gratification and meaningless acts of momentary pleasure that at the end of the day just deepen the feeling that I am a spine less loser that can't keep his promises. I wish to hear some of yall s stories and maybe you could tell me how you manage to stay clean and what helps you.I know sobriety is a very bumpy road and that there is no guaranteed way to kick it for sure, and for that reason it scares me even more as I m so used to failing that at times I don't even want to think about trying anymore.

addiction,Techgamingstudio,2020/3/26,"Think marijuana isn't addictive? Former users disagree  

In the basement of the Mustard Seed, a red brick building in Chicago's Old Town neighborhood that hosts dozens of Alcoholics Anonymous meetings each week, a handful of people gathered on a recent night to discuss a different addiction.

 

They were members of Marijuana Anonymous, a rapidly expanding 12-step organization that serves those struggling with a drug that is now legal in Illinois and 10 other states, and that many people view as innocuous.

That perception, some meeting attendees said, even extends to fellow drug users.

""When you're in rehab for weed, you don't say you're in rehab for weed,"" said Robb, a 30-year-old who lives in Chicago. ""Half the people will laugh you out of the room.""

But treatment specialists say marijuana's addictive potential is well-established. About 1 in 10 people who use the drug end up with the condition known as cannabis use disorder, meaning they continue to use compulsively even when it messes up their lives.

""It's a lot like the other addictions,"" said Michael Mahoney of Hazelden Betty Ford, a treatment center on Chicago's Near North Side. ""People want to stop using and can't. They have to use in greater quantities to get the same effect or just have a feeling of normalcy. Along the way, problems emerge.""

The Chicago Tribune spoke with people in recovery from marijuana addiction about those problems, the complexities of treatment and the reluctance of others to recognize the seriousness of the habit (as is customary for participants in 12-step programs, they asked to be identified only by their first names or no name at all).  
""Everyone I've told has been dumbfounded that it became an addiction,"" said Shelby, a 36-year-old woman from Chicago. ""It's hard for them to grasp that marijuana is addictive, and also that I used every day for the most part and no one knew. That's how secretive you can be, how good you can get at functioning on weed.""  
Shelby said she started smoking marijuana at 14?¡ª the odds of developing cannabis use disorder are 1 in 6 for people who first indulge when they're younger than 18?¡ª but it didn't really become an obsession until she moved to California as an adult.  
There, she said, the state's liberal medical marijuana law allowed her to buy the drug with little hassle (California has since legalized recreational sales), and THC-infused vape pens let her use discreetly anytime she wanted.

another important one is magnesium, a natural NMDA antagonist, calcium channels and GABA modulator ( [reference 6 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/30714574/) ,  [reference 7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507260/) [[reference 8](https://canprev.ca/all/magnesium-anxiety-depression-and-the-brain/) 



I¡¯m 20 days clean, and am currently suffering from psychological addiction. all this new year¡¯s partying are a strong trigger for someone like me. on desperation 6 days ago I bought magnesium chloride powder and started taking a teaspoon on the morning and another at night. yesterday I woke up feeling much lighter and overall feeling good. I didn¡¯t even connected one thing to another, I thought it was just my mind recovering, and today I noticed a huge mood-stabilizer activity from taking the magnesium. 

***I took magnesium only after consulting my doctor. this is an experience report and not a medical advice, always talk to your doc before ingesting any pharmaceuticals***

it really is working like a light general tranquilizer. i¡¯m not having the compulsive and intrusive thoughts I usually get, im smoking way less and overall enhanced mental clarity.

in conclusion it is doing wonders for me. if any of you reading this decide to take magnesium make sure you don¡¯t consume the laxative formulations (mainly oxide and hydroxide). if you are quitting opiates and take a laxative you gonna have a shitty time (pun intended)

magnesium chloride is not the best formulation, it is in the middle ground between the best and the worst, but it¡¯s what I have access to.

peace and a happy new year"

addiction,cazzofire,2020/3/10,"Should I be concerned? (Vyvanse) I (21M) was diagnosed with ADHD a few years back, after whole childhood of living with untreated attention problems. I have been prescribed several different stimulant meds since 2018 including Adderall, Evekeo, Concerta, and now Vyvanse 50mg. The thing is, I've been taking it every day and noticing that it has been working less than I would like as time goes on. I find myself thinking and doing concerning things. For example, there were a couple days that I took 2 of the 50mg capsules instead of 1, usually resulting in not a better focus but rather a manic episode of some sort. I don't know why I still have urges to take more than I'm supposed to since I know logically that more will not help me complete tasks such as studying and whatnot. I feel like I can't think logically and my impulsivity is just as bad, if not worse than it was untreated. Is it possible that I never had ADHD in the first place? I've suspected that I may have it since I found out about it in middle school. Also, the 3 psychiatrists I've been to all agree that I indeed have it and should be on stimulants. (I've been completely honest about my symptoms every time). 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been worried since before I was diagnosed that I would probably turn out to be addicted to this stuff if I've taken it long enough, and whoop-de-fuckin-doo here I am, sometimes impulsively taking 100mg of Vyvanse in a day, tossing and turning all night instead of sleeping.

&amp;#x200B;

So right now, I'm a few days away from spring break of senior year, midterm on Friday, and I'm stuck between continuing to take more for the next few days and try to study, since I will absolutely not take any during spring break, hopefully that will reset my tolerance and I'll be able to take it as a normal medication from there on out...... Or taking it as prescribed, which still gives me urges to indulge in whatever dopamine available since my tolerance is messed up, which also means I won't be able to concentrate on anything...... Or just give up this semester since I just recently came back from a mental hospital after a month of being absent from the semester, lying about my addiction in order to return. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I'm gaining tolerance to my ADHD medication (Vyvanse) and idk if I should keep increasing the dose to pass my midterm this week, depending on Spring Break next week to normalize my tolerance, or just give up this semester entirely and come clean for a few months, which also means I won't be able to graduate for another year."
addiction,DeepDish815,2020/2/17,"Looking for advice to help a friend struggling with addiction to benzos and alcohol Looking for advice about how to help a friend dealing with significant addiction problems. Two nights ago, an old friend reached out to me and another old friend seeking guidance and support about how to get sober. 
His specific problems include the following: at least two years of regular benzodiazepine and alcohol use, occasional other drugs including opiates and ketamine, a general anxiety and ADHD diagnosis, and a lot of past emotional trauma. He reached out clearly looking for help, but has overdosed on benzos and other drugs and taken himself to the hospital twice in the last 24 hours. Though at moments he wants to pursue a detox and rehab, at other moments he¡¯s angry and afraid about what the future holds, and that combined with withdrawal and addiction pushes him back to using. He lives out of state, so I¡¯m only currently able to help him remotely. He¡¯s in his late 20s, and has struggled with addiction on and off for about a decade. He had a very strained relationship with his parents, but they¡¯ve indicated that he¡¯s been at a hospital to treat overdose repeatedly over the last two years.

At 17 I was offered a job working on the oil fields, without hesitation I dropped out of school and moved away. My addiction began about 6 months after I began working there and it started innocently enough, giving a few dollars to homeless people and small loans to close friends. At 19 I was clearing over $100,000 a year and I started giving away large sums ($2000+) without even being asked. At 22 I walked away from that job in hopes I would stop once I was making less money, instead I know give away the vast majority of my money to the point I sometimes don't eat for a couple days to give away more.

for example: if you have anxiety, do you find that you are more susceptible to cravings when you are feeling anxious? 
as someone with bipolar and a pretty severe nicotine addiction (luckily i havent let myself indulge in much else besides marijuana) throughout the past year i have tried to quit multiple times. i have successfully stopped using nicotine for about 5 months, but that¡¯s the longest i can remember being off of it since before i started. i¡¯m beginning to feel like every time i try to quit, it is interrupted by a manic episode. the decision to purchase nicotine is usually a blur because it seems as if i¡¯m more inclined to abuse the substance when i¡¯m manic.

addiction,Spookylittlegirl03,2020/2/6,"Moment of clarity with addict boyfriend This evening I had a moment of clarity; my addict boyfriend is not going to change no matter how much I love him. We have been together 7 years since college, had plans to get married and buy a house, the whole life thing seemed pretty set. Two months ago we separated to take some time to think about what we really want (he mentioned he had changed his mind about wanting children and we agreed to take some time apart to think things through). Until living alone again, I hadn¡¯t realized how much I was suffering silently over the past 3-4 years from his daily drug and alcohol abuse. I beat myself up about my conflicting battle of thoughts constantly, going from feeling like an idiot by staying with him for so long to feeling guilty because ¡°love conquers all¡±. Well, I¡¯m not so sure it does anymore. I called him tonight and he was literally drinking and smoking while talking, seemed out of it but said he was ¡°tired¡± and didn¡¯t contribute more than a few distracted words to the conversation. After hanging up I just felt empty, lonelier than I had before calling him. In the past year I lost my two favorite uncles to alcoholism and I am having such strong remorse for them and thinking of what I will end up with if I stay with my partner. I feel like such a fool for staying for so long, especially with the family history and how I should¡¯ve seen it coming sooner. I don¡¯t know if this is even the right place to post this, but I just wanted to share and hopefully learn that I am not alone, because I feel very alone and scared about being 28 and having to start my life over again. It doesn¡¯t help that I love him so much, and am incredibly sad that I am watching my best friend poison himself and his surroundings every day, first hand knowing the consequences in store for him eventually.

I have an employee who I have helped over the last year with multiple issues involving drug abuse and suicidal tendencies. She is an active cutter and has cut herself deep enough that I have had to force her to go get medical care. She has an issue with benzos and this started to become a problem in the workplace. I gave her an ultimatum stating that if I find out shes continuing to use drugs, I will send her for a drug test and will have to let her go. I have been there for this person on an emotional and professional level and have multiple times gave her breaks despite my better judgement as a boss. I helped her get into a facility to help her with her suicidal feelings and it only seemed to help for a few weeks after she returned. Today she was in the parking lot when she wasn't working hours after she had clocked out and was falling over and covered in dirt with her friend claiming she had one drink and was not on benzos, just hasn't eaten in days thus the reason she was continously falling and completely incoherent. As a person who cares about her I worry about what her reaction would be to losing her job because her threats of suicide have felt so legitimate and because I know she doesn't have anything to fall back on. As a boss I feel like because other employees saw this and because I told her if I found out she was using again at work I would send her for a drug test that if I do nothing I will lose the respect of my employees and keep enabling her. This is a terrible explanation and there are alot of conversations and events that have occurred (too many to write) that paint a picture of us being very close on a level where she feels like I'm the only one in her life that is a positive influence and supporting her. I truly care about her and the idea of anything happening to her or her other getting clean truly hurts me. So I'm just curious as to what to do about the situation?"
addiction,theshizirl,2020/4/2,"How do you deal with knowing that struggles with addiction and sobriety won¡¯t just go away over time? I¡¯ve been struggling with alcoholism for years and the pattern is ill make it a year or two without having a drink, but then I¡¯ll slip up and drink, hide the behavior for a week or two, and then either get found out or come clean about it and restart the sobriety process.

My wife and friends are all extremely supportive and whenever I choose to talk about slipping up, the conversation is about why I didn¡¯t reach out when I got tempted in the first place and it¡¯s almost always me thinking I could just have the one drink and quit, or that I got in over my head and slipped up, got embarrassed and tried to hide it because I got ashamed.

Lately it dawned on me that every time I relapse (usually following several months or a year of sobriety) it comes after assuming I will ever stop being an alcoholic, or when I believe that I¡¯m better to some degree and can just say no to the habit.

I cant, and it seems like if I¡¯m gonna be real with myself, I¡¯m never gonna be able think I can have healthy drinking habits, and that this will always be a struggle to some capacity.

addiction,PsyleXxL,2020/1/11,"The essence of addictions All addictions boil down to the same principle: avoiding our deepest self.

In doing so we are avoiding pain, especially emotional pain. Indeed as emotional pain magnifies physical pain, the latter would be handled, accepted and eventually treated if we were in a state of pure consciousness: just raw presence without any reactions. So healing the root of emotional pain is the key. 

The universal solution is thus:  deeply facing ourselves. This entails facing our emotional pain with the power of Love and meditative presence.

The most important point to understand here is that our deepest self is immensely intelligent and beautiful, there is nothing to fear: even our pain is the expression of a very deep and beautiful intelligence, the embodiment of the Divine itself.

  We are scared of our darkness because we believe it is evil but in truth these hide the most stunning jewel in the universe: our true heart. 

We also have to understand that meditative pure presence itself is a miraculous medicine of the highest kind: when it is applied to emotional pain it will magically transmute it into bliss. That's right the truth is an alchemical one: transmuting darkness into light. This means that pain cannot be disgarded, it is an innate part of yourself and with knowledge it becomes the precious raw fuel that will get transformed into pure blissful love. 

In the end it was all about sitting with ourselves, with no distractions in the presence of Love. But in this modern world everyone is afraid to do that, even regular people who don't use drugs. All our life we are running away of ourselves with hyperactivity: jobs, drugs, hobbies, distractions, etc...

It may sound like a fairytale but this enlightened higher love is real. Many sages and masters have praised it since ancient times.

Now shamanic plant medicines are also showing us that this shadow work was the real key all along.  

For instance Iboga, the miracle plant that cures heavy addictions.  I have taken it...not for addictions but for emotional pain. It put me through very hard work, but I patiently carried on until the end because I knew that there was something beautiful on the other side of all this darkness I needed to face.

Darkness can be faced progressively in your day to day life or in an accelerated way through shadow work and plant medicines. Our choice.

 But the path is worth it."

&amp;#x200B;

this is my first post here ever - I have been looking at reddit for years and lately been trying to get my life back together. To give you a short overview, I am in my early twenties, good highschool diploma, top university business degree completed and currently interning with a consulting firm. So far my life for me appears to be entirely on track for everyone looking - I have money saved up, a loving girlfriend and family, great prospects for the future.

When I was younger I had a series of bad events and friends introduce me to consumption of various drugs and eventually nearly lost control of my life to the extent of being kicked out by my parents, losing almost all my friends and nearly fucking up high school - but managed to turn it around in the last second. I kind of quit - by saying kind of I mean i turned it into very, very occasional (1-2x / year) but started filling the gaps in between with other kinds of rushes. Be it nicotine, alcohol and in the past years also gambling (in the beginning with smaller amounts, lately with large sums). I managed to actually win quite a bit of money, then lost a portion of it again and decided to quit.

As soon as I did that I turned to drinking more and smoking more - when I try to stop I pick up something else again (even if it's ""just"" obsessive Gym going or something similar). 

Due to having a few days off lately I have been thinking of how to fight this addictive personality of mine - how to kind of lose this circle of ALWAYS having to have some kind of external rush. I seem to be able to say ""NO"" to one thing just to replace it again straightaway.

I have had terrible muscle pain for a few months to the point where it hurts just to walk, everyone seemed to think it was likely siatica and had a phone consultation with a doctor the other day he did as well, then after an excessive even for me cocaine binge, on my own, I thought I popped my shoulder out of place while rearranging in bed and I even posted in medical advice about it. My cocaine binge carries on until about an hour ago and the pain I thought was my shoulder dislocating was actually a muscle spasm continues as well. I did some research and found that it looks pretty likely that it's caused by my cocaine addiction or excessive use as well as the pain that's been stopping me from walking without pain. I've searched your site to see if anybody else has cited this problem from excessive cocaine use and found nothing but the pin has dropped, I don't need confirmation I already know and regardless I am a cocaine addict anyway, aside from my credit rating and finances I haven't completely ruined my life and still have my family and girlfriend none of whom know about my problem although they probably have suspicions, imagine if they found out there suspicion that I use cocaine is actually I am an addict.

addiction,HeavenlyShrimp,2020/4/2,"Is it okay to expose child to a vice ? So what I mean by the title is this: should I allow my hypothetical kid to get drunk or high and experience the bad part of enjoying a particular vice.


I'm saying this after remembering my younger self. My parents had an alcohol shelf in a wardrobe and my 10yo self would climb up and drink this stuff when I was home alone. Luckily never got drunk but it was something forbidden and fun. I remember thinking about how is it to be drunk and finally got to experience it when I was 14 and continued to do it it during first year of hs. I think if you forbid kid to drink something, it's gonna take first chance and drink it even if it doesn't oike it just to prove it's point. Same thing was with weed.



Now if I would demistify that feeling of mild vices to a kid and not having it believe it was some forbidden fruit, would it remove their classical teenage rebelious way of thinking and prevent them from abusing it in future.

Available in VIC, Australia - I didn't know it existed until a few weeks ago, but maybe something similar near you? I've been struggling with alcohol for over half my life (33f), cocaine use for the past 3 years, and a smorgasbord of consistent heavy recreational dabbling throughout. I went off the rails at the end of last year, and a dear group of friends stepped in for a heart wrenching (and admittedly very well done) intervention a few week ago.

I'm 3 weeks into this program called ""Ready 2 Change"": [https://www.directline.org.au/ready-2-change](https://www.directline.org.au/ready-2-change)

I was told of them when I spoke to an online counsellor here: [https://www.counsellingonline.org.au/](https://www.counsellingonline.org.au/)

I didn't like AA at all. I've responded well to SMART meetings in the past but I've been unable to attend meetings in person, the online ones weren't really cutting it. R2C have online modules to work through that echo the SMART Cognitive Behavioural Therapy approach. I'm really appreciating the one on one attention and my counsellor is wonderful. It's confronting as fuck, but it's helping remarkably with how overwhelming everything felt a few weeks ago. 

Hope this recommendation might be able to do something good for you, or at least help you find something similar in your area if it's your jam.

Thanks submates, it's nice to skim and not feel alone with this. Everyone is already doing something good for themselves by being here so kudos to you x"
addiction,frequentthinker4,2020/3/25,"I'm seriously hooked on weed and can't afford any for the first time in 2 years The ease and low profile of dab pens has been a major problem for me. The ability to just keep hitting it made it a lot easier to become addicted, especially for me as I had never smoked it any other way prior to when I started. I get high at every possible opportunity, which is, more often than not, all day. I've come off for a maximum of 5 days in the last 2 years, and that was how far I made it before I couldn't eat or sleep for 2 of those days straight. In light of recent events, I can't afford my next cartridge for a couple of weeks at least, so I'll be forced to stop cold turkey tomorrow since I finished what I had left tonight. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and maybe has some solid tips to cope, particularly when we're all stuck indoors and isolated.. I'm sorta terrified where my head will be at on top of the lack of sleep and food. Sorry for the length of this, I'm new to this subreddit but let me know if you can help in the comments; thanks in advance."

addiction,bighoecupajoe,2020/3/18,"Do I have to answer to recovery help hotline that will not stop calling? It¡¯s been a week since I made a phone call to a crisis hotline for substance abuse problems. 


After giving them my information, unfortunately I was not comfortable proceeding with their admissions process for several reasons. The responders made repeated attempts to get me to exaggerate my symptoms for insurance purposes and would not stop double checking to see if I had any alcohol addictions to help build my case for insurance to cover inpatient treatment. I refused, and was ultimately unhappy with the options that would be covered by my insurance. 



They have been calling me and my mom *daily* for an update on my sobriety and even after talking to me about my plan for recovery, they will not leave me alone. Today I received yet another call from them and expressed that they were beginning to impede my recovery with the harassment I am already getting from my new sponsor and support network. Responder was rude and in disbelief, angrily hung up on me. What can I do to make the calls stop?"
addiction,lilybee36,2020/3/17,"When do I call it quits? My husband is an addict. He told me about his addiction when we were in the plane to Mexico for our honeymoon. 2.5 years later, a stint in rehab that he left after a week, several tries at going out of state to get clean, I don¡¯t know how many weeks attempting to withdraw and do it himself, he is still using and only feels accepted by those he uses with. I don¡¯t do drugs, and haven¡¯t even experimented beyond the handful tries of weed over a decade ago. But the lies, manipulation, money, people stealing from my house, mood swings, anger, sudden bills and debts I have to pay for, I just don¡¯t know when I give up and accept that I am enabling him more than helping him through it. He continues to distance himself from me, spending all of his time with people that supply him drugs or people that buy drugs off him. He says he wants to be clean and to be with me and move forward in our lives with common goals, but I fear he is just telling me what I want to hear, just to smooth it over for a bit until the next time I find burnt foils  or baggies. 

I keep telling myself there has to be a line, that I have to leave and let him figure it out and realize if he wants to overcome the addiction for himself. But every time that line is crossed, I just keep moving the line hoping that somehow I can help him. I¡¯m just afraid I can¡¯t and that really my actions are more harmful in the long run."
addiction,One-Tomatillo,2020/2/4,"Friend is addicted to Ambien (took me a while to figure out) Hi guys, not sure why I'm writing this post except that this issue has been bugging me. Basically, I have an acquaintance/friend, let's call her ""Sally,"" who let it slip a couple times that she uses Ambien every day. She works night shifts at a hospital and  would have easy access to prescriptions. It's clear from the way she mentioned her Ambien use that she's already completely justified it to herself due to having ""insomnia"" and needing to sleep.

I do understand insomnia is a real problem for people. But you're not supposed to take Ambien for chronic, long-term use (longer than 2 weeks is considered excessive, apparently). I'm under the impression that Sally has been taking this drug for months, if not years, to cope with her work schedule and keep her job. But I can't help but wonder what the long term effects are going to be for her if she keeps up this lifestyle??

I've basically let the friendship go at this point due to Sally's odd behavior, such as sleeping all day (even on days when she's not working), not answering calls, and never calling back when she says she will due to sleeping, feeling sick/groggy, or having severe headaches. When we did manage to talk on the phone or in person, she just seems really sluggish and ""zombied-out."" I used to think that it was because she's just a naturally calm person, but when I finally put two-and-two together, I realized it's because she's hung over from taking Ambien the night before. The drug is constantly in her bloodstream!

I honestly don't understand how someone could justify the daily use of a powerful hypnotic-sedative drug like Ambien? I've tried a few sleeping pills in the past (like Advil PM), and that shit makes me feel horrible the next day. 

Can someone please give me insight into my friend's addiction and what the long-term consequences could be for her? I don't know if I should say anything. I don't feel it's my place to bring it up, but if it does come up at some point in the future, I don't know if I could hold back my opinion since it's clearly a damaging habit to have. 

Reading the reports of long-term Ambien abuse online are scary.

Thanks &amp; peace."
addiction,chillychese,2020/4/12,"Sobriety For the sober people in this sub, does being sober ever truly feel as good when you were getting high. I've been tempted to try going sober for the first time in years, but I don't know if I could get over the first few weeks."
addiction,pewyroll,2020/2/19,"Coming up on my Third month clean.. for around 12 years I was hooked on an ungodly amount of opiates all from my appendix bursting when I was 18, stopping was something I never thought I could achieve. I'd have swore to myself before this I never would have been able to do this and that I would probably died because of them at some point if not ended up with a life altering medical problem, Opiates are an awful plight to get caught in yet I understand that they can help people (even if they are far too overprescribed), but I am so happy to be free of the grasp. that doesn't mean that all cravings are gone but I feel strong enough to resist the urge finally and when they do kick in I try to do something to take over that addictive behaviour. 

In the last 3 months I've massively turned my life around, my mental health has improved, I've started going to the gym every other day, actively getting out of bed and not just lying there facing the wall waiting for hours to pass. Hell I have psoriasis and even my skin is clearing up..  
I feel lucid and clear and have even gone and seen old friends &amp; family and they've remarked upon the improvement, it's also great to be able to go somewhere and not have to worry about where the nearest pharmacy is or withdrawal setting in and the persistent diarrhea. I'm glad to have my life back, and though i wish i could have done it sooner, and not fucked up my education by flunking out of university and being unable to maintain any relationships, I can now begin planning my life and actually stick to it, though its still early days so I'm okay with just taking baby steps for now.  
I have to thank this Subreddit because it wasn't all that long ago that I made a post about being close to suicide because of  this, and the users who spoke to me sparked something in me to finally turn my life around (granted it was a few more months of using, but everyone needs to do things at their own speed right?)   


The last thing I need to stop now is the Cigs and the sugary caffeine drinks i began pounding after first starting my treatment, as it's already fucked my dental health up.. though if it gets to a certain point I'm just going to have my teeth replaced by implants i suppose..  
But again Thank you r/addiction I wouldn't have thought it was possible without reading stories here of success against the odds, aswell as the people who spoke frankly and wished me well. If you are stuck in a similar situation. All is not lost, you can do it too! and I'd like to help the way I was helped here..  


Thank you all

addiction,_Nycey_,2020/3/1,"I¡¯m addicted to escaping Ever since I was little, I¡¯ve spent all my time doing everything except for what I was supposed to be doing. I grew up with divorced parents that never spoke directly to each other, it was only through my older sister, my younger brother, and me.
I rarely ever delivered the message as it usually had something very mean and nasty to say to the other one, unless it was saying when our family events would be. In response to not relating the message, I¡¯d simply lose time reading Calvin and Hobbes, playing game boy, or playing Xbox through the years.
I went to school in a very, very small private school for most of my life, where I barely did any homework. I guess it was the schools belief that a failing student should pass anyways. So I spent my days doing everything other than what I was supposed to education wise. I enveloped myself in interests that I found interesting, not school, but now this post is getting longer than I¡¯d imagined, so I¡¯ll sum it up.

I¡¯m addicted to escaping life as a whole, and it¡¯s been video games, relationships, and food, but now that I¡¯m realizing that those are all just escapes from life, I feel that there¡¯s a much easier way"

addiction,larteaga012820,2020/1/28,"What is the best Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Program that can help to Overcome Addiction? At the moment, there are many options for Alcoholism treatment. This article is written to give some basic information about this treatment. One of the options you have in treatment is inpatient Drug detox treatment.

If you suffer from a substance abuse problem, then [Women Drug Rehabs](https://www.womendrugrehabs.com/) will help you overcome your addiction. It will not just give you detoxification but also provide treatment. This treatment can be complete or partial. It depends on the severity of your addiction and the type of center you want to go to.

If you are staying at a residential drug detox center, then you will be given a total body detox. This is very important because it allows you to be free from any type of addictive substances. The main reason for this kind of treatment is to be free from any type of harmful substance.

If you are going to the outpatient part of the treatment, then you can visit a detox center or a treatment center anytime of the day. This is completely optional, but most people prefer it. However, you still need to go to your designated area in order to complete the treatment. This is very important in order to provide you with total detoxification.

A drug detoxification center can help you get into recovery after they give you a detoxification program. Once you are free from the substance, you can always go back to the center if you so wish.

One of the best things about a drug detoxification center is that they provide complete treatment without any restrictions. With this option, you can feel like the treatment will never end. There are not any withdrawal symptoms that you have to deal with. You just need to move on with your life after finishing the program.

If you feel like drinking alcohol every night, then this is the treatment for you. You will no longer have problems with alcohol. This can be done in a supervised way. You will have to pay money and live in a residential center.

The Rehabilitation Hospital In-patient alcohol rehab center is for those who suffer from alcohol dependency. If you are suffering from [alcoholism](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/), then this type of treatment may be best for you. After treatment, you can live your life normally without having to drink.

If you choose the outpatient alcohol detox center, then you need to schedule time for treatment every week. This type of treatment is for those who are not suffering from any type of substance abuse problem.

Inpatient treatment may be better than outpatient detox center. This type of treatment allows you to give it a try even if you do not want to stay in a facility for a long time. When you need some time away from home, alcohol rehab centers are there to provide you with the same treatment that is available in any residential centers.

Every Alcohol rehab centers can provide you with different types of treatment. However, the fact remains that inpatient treatment is the most suitable one. However, if you are truly suffering from alcoholism, then go for any type of treatment that is recommended by your doctor."
addiction,throwaway2463684,2020/1/1,"I think my friend relapsed I haven't known her for too long, but we text almost every day and have gotten to know each other rather well. She got pregnant a couple weeks ago through a one-night-stand and is not in a position to keep it, so she just had an abortion yesterday, and is taking it rather rough because of the side effects. She's rather open about her life, so right around when we first met she told me that she's a recovered heroin addict and has been clean for 2 years.

I just found out a few hours ago that she might have relapsed early this morning. I can't say the source and I'm not 100% positive, but someone that knows her said that he found her bathtub splattered with blood with a needle laying in it. She got her abortion through a pill, so that explains the blood, but I can't figure out why she would have a needle there as well, and the only thing I can think of is that the stress of the last few weeks got to her and she relapsed. I've been doing my best to try and support her through this time in her life since she found out she was pregnant, but I worry that it wasn't enough and she just needed an extra something to calm down... 

We met on a business trip a couple months ago, so I don't know her family or have any mutual friends with her, I only found out about the bathtub through a fluke, technically I shouldn't have that info at all. 

I don't know what to do. 

If I confront her about it and tell her how I found out, that would only piss her off and end our friendship, and she would still be relapsing and learn to hide it better from her friends and family, since I haven't quite known her long enough to talk to her about things like that and I shouldn't even know about it at all. 

I can probably try and contact her brother, who knows of me, but doesn't know me personally, and see if I can show him the evidence of what that person said so that he knows the situation, looks into it, and can try and help her like I assume he did 2 years ago. But since he doesn't really know me, he might think I'm lying and brush me off, tell her, and then our friendship is over and she learns to hide it better.

I can just try and do nothing, and pretend like I never saw what that person wrote, but I don't think I can do that. I've really gotten to know her these past few weeks and we've opened up to each other about some more personal issues in our lives, and I look forward to talking with her every day. If I just leave it alone, I fear it will only get worse, it'll be too late to help her, and she might OD and I'll never be able to talk to her ever again. Just thinking about it hurts. I've been rather lonely these last few years, and I don't know if I can deal with losing one of my closest and only friends, let alone in this manner, knowing that I could have helped.

The only idea I have left is to wait a few days and pretend like I just found out that one of my other friends relapsed, and to ask her how I can help this imaginary friend. I can talk about this imaginary friend the same way that I'm talking about her, and hopefully she'll draw some parallels to her own situation and realize that she needs help. 

Unfortunately, life dealt her a bad hand, and she's been struggling every day to get by for a while now. Even if she does decide that she needs help, I don't know how she'll go about it. She's not even close to being well-off and is on the verge of being homeless, so I don't know if rehab is even an option. Growing up sheltered in an upper-middle class family, I really don't have any experience with any of this and I don't even know where to start, only that I want to help any way that I can. 

Even though I have some reason to doubt what that person said he saw, I can't help but think back to our previous conversations and how she would stop replying for a while, only to text back saying that she was ""taking a nap"". She might have relapsed a while ago, and I might not even know it. But maybe on the other hand that guy was lying and she's stayed clean this whole time. I have no way of knowing, since we don't live near each other at all, and I haven't seen her since I met her on that business trip. Maybe I'm overreacting and she just slipped up once to try and counter the side effects of her abortion pill, which is making her feel very sick, and that she's never planning on doing it again. I don't want to take that chance though, I've heard that heroin is a very addictive drug and that even if she was only planning on doing it once she might slip and start doing it more and more until she's addicted again. I'm so confused, hurt, and clueless; I don't want to lose my friend."

addiction,shrimp__,2020/4/20,"Weed+Gaming+Love Hello redditers,

I¡¯ll try to describe the rather difficult situation I am in as short as I can... Well, I (32) live about a year now with my partner (36) a heavy cannabis smoker (about 6-7 joints on daily basis) with successive gaming habits since his childhood. ¡°Successive¡± meaning he plays daily about 7-8 hours DOTA when I am in home-office mode, when I am not at home he plays¡­ until I come back. Please keep reading :D

I knew he was a gamer and smoked of course before we moved together, but I didn¡¯t realize the whole situation. However, after a year of long distance relationship he immigrated to the country I live: he wanted to be with me and develop his career. I believe that his work until then (a crazy well paid home-office job in an international organization) helped him ¡°cultivate¡± and establish his habits¡­ seeming normal to the rest of the world: He would work only a few (5-6) days per month and earn fcking lot of money for the average wage there. As he came here, he kept of course his home-office work just to have a backup and search for the vacancies here, learn the language etc¡­ And after a year here he did exactly¡­ nothing. He didn¡¯t even meet another person except my friends and his dealer. Really. Writing this I realize again how crazy this is. At first he said it was the time for integration he needed, then it was the summer-holiday season, afterwards came my pressure and my questions ¡°ehm don¡¯t you play too much?¡± that destructed him¡­ then it was suddenly Christmas¡­ now you can imagine what happens with the lockdown. 

Now everytime I confront the situation he persuades me in the end with his charm and intelligence, that a big part of this situation is my fault: he moved because of me in a city he didn¡¯t want to, he knows nobody here and I was a monster who was always criticising him and didn¡¯t support enough. And from time to time I sink in the depression that somebody who lives with a person like this sinks and feel completely devastated, thinking I did all wrong and I really didn¡¯t support him¡­

I believe there are a lot of people here, that in one way or another are in similar situations, so we can maybe brainstorm a bit together? Is there any possibility to support a person, who is in complete denial about stopping? In the beginning he was lying to me and his friends who tried to intervate, now he says that he wants to build a functional life and REDUCE the hours and the joints (but not stop for a period and detox) though he has no input except 9gag and YouTube, no hobbies except his computer and found his new explanation, that it is the fault of his girlfriend?

\*Of course I tried already the suggestion to go to therapy, even as a couple, and the answers are balancing between laughing me out about trying to help, ¡°you don¡¯t understand the situation¡± and ¡°I cannot afford this¡± or ¡°I need to solve other things before, like career etc¡±. But still, do you have positive experience with therapy (or no therapy) in this field?

I hope it all makes sense - If you made it till here, thanks for reading people! :)"

addiction,Steven-CMD,2020/3/2,"Looking for input for my thesis Hey everyone,

Sorry if this post is not appropriate for this subreddit, so please delete if needed. I¡¯m a student from the Netherlands and currently working on my thesis. In short it¡¯s about what can we do for those people that are directly affected by someone else¡¯s addiction (partner, kids, parents etc.). Nowadays there are quite a few solutions for people that have an addiction, but way less for the people around them. My studies are related to communication, multimedia and design, so I¡¯m looking at it from that point of view.

My question is if some people (preferably those affected by the addiction of someone else) are willing to give their opinion and input on the things I¡¯m working on. Of course everything will be completely anonymous. Things can range from some rapid questions about small things and maybe even helping me test my digital prototype.

addiction,arth365,2020/2/26,"A message to newly addicted folks, read this if you¡¯d like to skip a few years of being in and out of hell and possibly multiple rehabs There is a chance we all have as addicts, to drop it and be clean without the dependency monster to come and make us feel like shit. I myself was not in a place where I could stop so I kept going even though I had multiple chances to take the easy road. There is an opportunity or multiple opportunities that every one of us gets in which we can drop the substance that we are addicted and dependent two and leave it right there with minimum withdrawal¡¯s as though an angel Grace¡¯s you and gives you a chance but leaves you solely responsible for your future of addiction.  

I have been through years of addiction and dependency, over eight years at this point now. Early on in my heroin an opiate addiction when it had just started to get bad I had some times where I had tried to quit and it was very difficult because I felt the withdrawals. But also in that area of time I found hope and I found the want to stop for multiple reasons. At this point I gave it up but there was something different about this time, I gave up heroin I begged for no withdrawals and somehow I had very little. Some minor chills but nothing to the extremes of hell and addiction. I remember this time in this day like it was yesterday. I think God for not having to go through what I went through the week or so before and promised myself and The universe that I would never do it again. I took this opportunity and I threw it right into the trash and here I am over eight years later.

Everyone has a chance to get the monster off your back early on with much more ease, the contradicting part is that it¡¯s also quite difficult at this point because you have just gotten started and you don¡¯t see it being that bad because you aren¡¯t intelligent and seasoned in the addiction world yet, you haven¡¯t learned just how awful of a road you¡¯re going down. 

As all seasoned users and addicts who have gone through withdrawal and dependency know, once you get going it becomes worse and worse. As you go farther down the road of your addiction and dependency even if you stop for a couple months and feel better, if you start again it will be that much worse. The road gets harder no matter what but you will be given a chance to break free early on without much suffering from withdrawal if any at all. 



I speak to everyone who gets this chance. Anyone who finds themselves away from their drugs and addiction for a day and thinks that they can make it without using, just stop then and there and save yourself from years of hell and misery. If you pick it up again after you¡¯ve been given your chance and you¡¯ve already experienced the hell of withdrawal then mark my words and understand that you very well may never get another chance without having to go through a total shit storm."

addiction,avimech85,2020/3/10,"The Story Of Doug Felone (Drug Felon) Doug is an average guy who worked hard to get through school and has always held a solid earning job. He is a friendly guy with a lot of friends. He¡¯s mild tempered and mild mannered. He¡¯s never caused harm to another being, abides by the basic laws of society and had a perfectly clean record.

One day Doug is out riding his bicycle and gets struck by a car. He gets treated at the hospital and for his recovery is given pain meds. One day he runs out of his pain meds; he starts vomiting, has diarrhea and more pain than he could ever imagine. The doctor won¡¯t prescribe more meds and his insurance refuses to cover the $900 a day for a basic rehab facility. All he wants to do is alleviate the anguish until he can figure out what to do in order to get his life back on track, so he illegally acquires some pills from a friend of a friend. Unbeknownst to him this person is under surveillance.

A few days later the police show up at his house to inform him that they have him on film purchasing drugs from a known dealer. Doug is booked into county jail where he is surrounded by real criminals, until he is able to make bail. A year of court proceedings ensue until the prosecutor has a ¡°sweet¡± deal to offer him; accept a felony charge, four months in jail and three years of probation or he could take a gamble by going to trial and risk up to six years in prison. Out of fear Doug accepts the deal, Doug Felone is now a drug felon.

Upon his release from jail, he is now clean and starting life over again. He goes out to apply for jobs but ends up getting turned down at every place he applies due to his felony record. His years and money spent in college are now worthless, yet he still owes tens of thousands in student loan debt. In addition to that it is also difficult for him to find a decent place to live, he is finding that most leasing agencies won¡¯t rent to felons, regardless of having good credit and an eviction-free record. Many of his friends no longer want to associate with him, not because his was an addict for a brief time, but because he is now considered a criminal. Everything he has worked for in his life has now gone to waste. Doug is now a second rate citizen who can no longer contribute to society in ways he was once able to.

Doug feels as though he is left with only two options. First option is to work a menial, low paying job in which he will never get caught up in life and will never be financially stable again. The second option appears to be more lucrative, however it may involve scamming others, selling drugs or robbery.

There is a reason the crime recidivism rate is much higher for a felon as compared to someone with a misdemeanor or someone who is given the option of court ordered rehab. It may be easy to judge someone based on the fact they are or once were an addict, however it¡¯s not always that black and white. Some others grow up in a household where addiction is rampant and it is all they know. Regardless of how they became an addict, do they deserve the right to have a fair chance at life, or should they forever be labeled a felon and be treated as such? What option would YOU take if you were in Doug¡¯s shoes?

Limiting felons from equal employment opportunities causes an estimated loss of $87 billion in gross domestic product every year in the US. In addition it leads to non-violent criminals finding other ways to get ahead in life, such as committing crimes which can cause harm to others."

addiction,justwalkmeg,2020/2/9,"Cousin is a recovering addict.. trying to be motivational.. need advice Long story short, my older cousin is a recovering heroin addict; previous suicide attempts; about a year clean; father to a 5 year old (the mother of his child is absolutely awful and fuels the fire intentionally by making it nearly impossible for him to spend time with his daughter even with family supervision); extremely pessimistic, unmotivated, and depressed; and I¡¯m the only person around (he hasn¡¯t made friends here, all our family lives out of town).


So in summary, I am trying to be supportive as best I can. Although our work schedules are completely opposite I invite him over as much as possible, he usually flakes and doesn¡¯t come, when he does he either gets completely hammered drunk or stays for about an hour and dips out.. I¡¯m assuming because he just feels socially awkward and doesn¡¯t know how to hang out sober.


I¡¯ve tried to be as supportive as possible, when he texts me big long sob stories late at night, obviously drunk, I try my best to be understanding and positive, although I just want to shake him and tell him to not up and deal with it, life is hard for everyone. I have tried a bit of tough love, still being nice but trying to express that his attitude towards life is going to effect his outcome. I just feel like I¡¯m at a loss and I can¡¯t help him if he won¡¯t help himself. My mother is a recovering meth addict and has basically ruined any sympathy I have for addiction making this situation even harder.

addiction,babyboi1998,2020/1/29,"Not quite a ''Drug'' but i am almost 24 hours clean of Caffeine. I have been consuming about 12 liters of caffeinated beverages per week. After my Urinary incontinence returned and my bladder was acting like a 60 year old, i decided to take action and stop having anything caffeinated. It really does feel weird now, i feel a bit of depression and a low dissociative mood, i am not sure if this is withdrawal. Since stopping the caffeinated drinks my bladder is starting to become normal again. The results are still inconclusive. I have been drinking apple juice and water.

It says the caffeine half life is about 5-6 hours meaning about 12-13 hours to fully clear out, but because i had so much maybe it will take a further few days to completely get out of my system and bladder? Since drtinking the apple juice i feel much more hydrated and don't get the urge to refill my cup every 10 minutes like i did with the coca cola and other caffeine energy drinks.

My urinary incontinence was initially a side effect or believed to be a result of my antipsychotics, however the caffeine was likely the main cause.

addiction,tuvo,2020/3/29,"What¡¯s the end goal for a person with multiple addictions/addictive personality? Throughout my adolescent life I¡¯ve always been addicted to at least a number of destructive habits. To name a few it¡¯s been video games, smoking cigarettes, party drugs, alcohol and gambling (the last two being the worst, but I¡¯ve got many more bad habits). My only question is, how does a person of this nature get free from these addictive traits and simply become what one would imagine as ¡°normal¡±. 

Because I¡¯ve tried many times at quitting one or more of these habits and simply find another addiction taking it¡¯s place and becoming more dominant. Then theres the argument thinking I can take things in moderation, leading to hard relapses and the eventual full circle (myself simply taking part in all my addictions, to a certain degree). 

I¡¯ve read several books on battling addiction but I can¡¯t imagine a person with a dominant addictive personality just somehow cutting all ties and becoming totally sober. I truly believe there¡¯s people like myself that just are consumed and addicted by several different things/habits. 

So back to my title, is the end goal just simply becoming sober from all these habits? Because moderation simply doesn¡¯t work and if I dedicate myself to being completely sober, what else is there left to enjoy? I just don¡¯t see how complete sobriety beats this, and from my experience moderation does not work either. 

Thank you"
addiction,ZepNess,2020/3/28,"Information Addiction Step 1 # Step 1: We admitted that we were Powerless over Information; that our lives have become unmanageable.

**Tl;DR:** Stop trying to control Information.

As a hunter on the great plain 100,000 years ago you spot the herd you¡¯ve been tracking for weeks. Your senses heighten¡ªyour eyes dilate; your muscles twitch with anticipation of your next move. Every fiber of your being aligns for one singular purpose¡ªa successful kill.

In those hostile and uncertain times you could rely on two things¡ªyour body reacting to novel information, and your ability to focus on what this information is telling you.

Maybe in a sea of green you discover a splash of blue. Is that a bushel of berries to be picked and eaten and shared?

Is that rustling of leaves and a cracking of a twig in the pitch black darkness as you rest by the fire a predator poking around and hoping to make you its next meal?

Is the wind blowing in your direction protecting you and masking your scent from your imminent kill?

In this idealized and no doubt romanticized notion of early man¡¯s existence relying on novel information was essential to survival. Ignoring it could be disastrous for you and your tribe. And not acting properly in accordance with what you¡¯ve been taught by the gatekeepers of information¡ªthe elders of your people who relay the wisdom gained from perhaps centuries of failure and turmoil and death¡ªhelp you become more efficient and effective for the group. Not adhering could get you and everyone you know killed.

The ability to focus and the ability to discern¡ªtwo key tactics in our ability to survive. Period.

It is time to relearn those valuable skills in this day and age in order for us to survive.

What happened to our ability to do this and what can we do about it now?

Before these questions are answered, or rather, explored, we need to take a look at our main adversary of the 21st century¡ªInformation.

Information is neutral and cares not of your beliefs, values, opinions, or preferences. Information is all of these things, and much, much more.

What is Information? In a word¡ªEVERYTHING!

The brain does not rest¡ªit is constantly processing, recording, and transmitting Information.

And for most of our history it seems that this was the only technology in the known universe capable of performing these functions to such a high level.

This all changed dramatically with the invention of the computer.

In TK, John Von Neumann wrote his book, *The Brain and the Computer*.

In his book, Von Neumann says a lot of things that I can barely comprehend but that¡¯s ok because this is the first draft and I¡¯m here and we¡¯ll sort it out later.

But the point is, the idea of using the computer as a model to understand our brains was introduced and the way of thinking is as old as computing itself.

This will be explored in more detail later.

Our brains and our bodies¡ªthe basic human hardware, has not changed much since it has fully formed around TK thousand years ago.

What has changed¡ªsignificantly¡ªis the software.

Where our brave and courageous ancestors rarely saw radical or life-altering differences to their environment and technologies¡ªour current state is in perpetual change and flux and overload.

Even so back to 50 years ago when Alvin Toffler, the great futurist and writer, popularized the expression, ¡°information overload¡± in his book, *Future Shock*.

Information overload was used to describe what future humans ,i.e. us, are going to be dealing with in our current age of information. However, even back then people began to feel the deluge of information of their psyche and the term became popular to describe their era of three television channels beaming information into their brains at home.

How quaint.

And now here we are with three or more streaming services in our pocket, access to all the information we couldn¡¯t consume in a million lifetimes, and a video platform which has around [8 hours of content uploaded](https://www.statista.com/statistics/259477/hours-of-video-uploaded-to-youtube-every-minute/) every second. That¡¯s around 500 hours, or 20 days of content uploaded every minute!

In the time it took to read that last paragraph, about a week's worth of content has just been uploaded. Yikes.

Social media platforms, designed to keep your eyeballs locked in, are working hard to keep your attention on them in a perpetual state of agitation¡ªflight/flight and paralysis from Too Much Information.

¡°Big Brother isn't watching. He's singing and dancing. He's pulling rabbits out of a hat. Big Brother's busy holding your attention every moment you're awake. He's making sure you're always distracted. He's making sure you're fully absorbed.He's making sure your imagination withers. Until it's as useful as your appendix. He's making sure your attention is always filled.And this being fed, it's worse than being watched. With the world always filling you, no one has to worry about what's in your mind. With everyone's imagination atrophied, no one will ever be a threat to the world.¡±

More and more apps are developed every day to make you more productive or to help you meditate or focus or to track your screen time.

Is that really the answer you need? More information to combat information?

Is the latest and greatest gizmo or app the right call when you¡¯ve never even developed a coherent and stable structure/philosophy of technology use?

What good is having the best sea-liner in the middle of Wyoming?

What¡¯s the point of owning a snowboard in Fiji?

Why are you trying so hard to control the flow of information, and how is that working out for you?

Do you feel in control? Does your life seem manageable?

How effective are you at doing the work and solving the problems you are uniquely designed to solve?

Although it is useful to understand the flow and history of information, what is most needed now are new maps to navigate the Info-Universe we all inhabit and for most, are being crushed by.

The first step to recovering from an addiction is to admit that you¡¯re powerless over it, and that it is making your life unmanageable.

Trying to control the flow of information¡ªor even worse¡ªtrying to keep up with the latest headlines and gadgets and apps and trends¡ªdoes not work.

If it did, you¡¯d be able to shut off your device right now, step outside, and go for a walk and have no anxiety about what you¡¯re missing out on with the latest tweet, post, or snap.

You could see others in the world and not nervously reach for your device to sooth your nervousness around conversation.

The song you hear at the grocery store could be just that¡ªand not some song you must identify and look up and add on five playlists and share on seven platforms.

[Phantom vibration syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_vibration_syndrome), where you feel your device vibrate in your pocket when it¡¯s not there, would not exist.

Do you still feel in control?

Again, the brain does not rest. So even if you¡¯re physically unplugged from info-beaming screens for a spell¡ªyour attention and what you focus on, is still processing information and if you¡¯re agitated by this and are frustrated by your inability to smooth your mind and be present and still then what are we to do?

Is there really a human solution¡ªan app or a hack or your willpower¡ªthat can really solve this problem for you?

I haven¡¯t come across one yet, and I think that¡¯s the point.

What one may call God, The Source, Universal Consciousness, Higher Power, Simulation Overlords¡ªwhatever¡ªis the overwhelming and awesome information that exists in all realms and planes and dimensions of existence.

Our ancestors understood this¡ªand found great meaning in the stars and their environment and their community.

While the ideal of the individual in recent centuries has proven immensely valuable in helping us recognize the inherent worth of each human with a functioning nervous system to generate potential in either direction¡ªgood or bad, heaven or hell, etc.¡ªwhat these computers have given us is an immense gift to our consciousness¡ªa model of understanding ourselves¡ªour limitations, our vulnerability and frailty, but also, our strength and resilience in dealing with adversity.

It makes about as much sense to me to say, ¡°I am human¡± as it does to say ¡°I am the Walrus.¡±

Because at the end of the day, we have NO CLUE what we are and what we are capable of.

Past events and experiences need not dictate future events.

If we can leverage our minds and leverage the vast potential of nearly 8 billion super computers walking around on this planet to get to work solving real problems that need solving for our continued existence and success on this planet and beyond¡ªthen who knows what we will be capable of and what we will become.

This is an attempt to create new maps to explore this vast and treacherous territory we are all immersed in.

For the opportunity to reach and inspire and empower others on a global scale has never existed like this before.

But it all starts with you.

So, if you¡¯re ready for more in your life¡ªmore meaning and purpose and challenge, you must first surrender to the unfathomable power of Information and learn to become a vessel for its unique code meant for you to discern and focus on.

That all starts with a simple, yet difficult admission¡ªthat you are powerless over Information, and that your life has become unmanageable."

She suffers from depression, anxiety, and recently psychosis. 
Her argument is that she was more functioning when she high. And part of me agrees with her. 
When she was using, she was at college (UK) studying and gained good results, going in for every lesson, and leaving the the house on days off with me to do activities together. 

Since sober, she has attempted university but couldn¡¯t manage it (which is absolutely understandable and fine) but has since locked her self away, rarely leaving the house. She sleeps until 14:00 (when I finish work). I encourage to do things together but she is content in sitting in silence without any stimulation during evenings. 

Due to antipsychotic medication she has put on weight (which in itself is not a problem) but she feels worthless because of it; believes people stare at her if she leaves the house - which has prevented her from going to NA meetings. 

In short: she wants to use again so she can function again, and I don¡¯t know what I can say or do to help her stay sober."

addiction,Arten2x,2020/2/4,"Unhealthy obsession with adult games. Hello guys,

I've  been browsing the subs for the past few hours deciding where to post  this because I'm not sure. Feel free to remove it or move it if I'm in  the wrong place.

Let me preface  the rest of this post by saying that this is probably a laughable  matter, especially taking into account what other people go through and  this most certainly isn't easy for me to write but I really don't know  anymore.

So I've had a rough  couple of years with a series of deaths in the family that were months  apart, which brought on quite a lot of stress and financial strain but  things have been clearing up recently. I also lost the connection with  most of my friends. During that time when things were quiet I discovered  a few adult (porn) that I really enjoyed and they've helped me relax,  and them having updates it allowed me to get invested.

The  issue started manifesting when those type of games started adding more  ""group oriented"", content (NTR and such). I quit playing them of course  as I'm more of a vanilla kind of a guy when it comes to these issues.  But I'm constantly being drawn back to them and it makes me feel  horrible like it's actually happening to me (they're pixel character for  f's sake). It's been a few months and whenever something reminds of  those games I get anxious and start feeling down and unmotivated which  has led to me feeling hollow, I cannot find enjoyment in anything that I  try to occupy myself with.

This  has extended to impact anything that has a sexual component in it when  it comes to entertainment material (comics, games etc.) I have no such  issues when viewing regular adult material, also I'm quite able to  discern that this has nothing to do with real life so it doesn't cause  me issues with normal human interaction.

I'm  reaching a breaking point and I feel totally dazed and embarrassed, I  could never have imagined that I would have this kind of a issue."

Today is 8 days since my last cigarette (I'm using nic patches though), 2 days since I last watched porn, and about 20 hours since I've last smoked weed (probably the longest I've gone without it in months).

I'm no stranger to addiction, and I have many friends and family members who are users. My intention isn¡¯t to write some sort of scare piece,, so much as to highlight the public health issues that government officials might be overlooking (such as closing liquor stores and forcing alcoholics to either go through serious withdrawals, or engage in even riskier behavior.)

You can either reply here for public discussion, or if you'd prefer to DM me, we can communicate through Reddit, encrypted email, or whatever your preferred method is.  Information shared will be completely anonymous (I won't even include screen names -- pseudonyms are encouraged).

Thanks so much for any feedback you have. Stay safe and stay healthy."
addiction,AMonsterMask,2020/3/15,"The doctor said that I should stop taking medicine that I don't need. I don't know how else to pass the time. I went to the doctor recently (my first adult, non-pediatric doctor), and he basically said that I'm extremely depressed, and that it seems like I'm using caffeine and pain killers in an attempt to remedy that. He told me to drink less energy drinks, and only take medicine when I need to, because it could cause serious damage to me if I continue this.
  
  
I'm sitting at home now, staring at walls, feeling tingles in my fingers,  occasionally having full-body shivers for whatever reason. I haven't had any pain medicine in days, and I've only had one can of Monster. 
  
  
I normally would have had like three cans by now, and I would have taken naproxen or a few swings of Nyquil with each can. I would be switching between jitters and drowsiness for the next few hours and just enjoying the ride. 
  
  
Instead, I feel nothing. I feel empty, and I have no will to live. I have two more days until I work again, and now, I'm having to find creative ways to pass the time and ease some of the weird aches and pains that I'm dealing with."

One habit that I believe is causing a lot of problems is his drinking. He¡¯ll drink probably 6-12 shots of vodka every day. I realize that probably isn¡¯t much compared to many here, but I think the problem is that he can¡¯t stop. He never gets drunk or anything, he never acts different while he drinks, but the fact that he¡¯s consuming so much vodka in a week is concerning to me, especially when he keeps gaining weight and I know the alcohol isn¡¯t helping.

How would you start the conversation with someone when you aren¡¯t sure if they really qualify as an alcoholic? We¡¯ve talked about it before, but it never lasts long.

addiction,mossvd,2020/4/14,"non-mainstream addictions Ever since I've managed to overcome my addiction, I've been feeling like some kind of outcast, like I wasn't an OG. Why is that? Well, because I'm not addicted to opiates or alcohol. I'm addicted to an MMO video game called World of Warcraft. It all started when I got my first computer as a kid, and lasted for the last 12 years, throughout my entire education. It basically ruined my entire life: I've failed high school, wasted literally thousands of dollars, made a suicide attempt, started having problems with my back (sitting for 15 hours straight every day isn't the best for your back :d) Happily, these days are gone, but it wasn't an easy road. Hours of therapy, relapses, trying to find a meaning in life, which felt incredibly empty, sometimes still does. I'm going through the same shit every other addict does: constant scare of relapsing, missing the ""fantastic"" times when I used to play for days with only taking breaks for a breakfast, fighting with myself each day. 

And yet I still feel like I'm not worthy to be a part of the community. Like my addiction is a piece of cake compared to what those addicted to benzos or alcohol had to overcome. But the only difference is the physical aspect - at least that's what it seems like.

What's even worse is the fact, that I'm not the only one, who feels that way. The entire society warns about benzodiazepines or opiates, but nobody really talks about all other addictions, which can tear lives apart. These addictions seem to be very abstract to people. Try telling someone that you are an recovering alcoholic - the reaction will be wonderful. Then tell another person, that you've struggled with porn addiction - they probably won't be too enthusiastic.

What I am trying to say is basically not to underestimate the success of those, who recovered - no matter what they were addicted to. Show as much love to these people, as you would show to alcoholics and drug addicts - we all know they need it. 

Oh, and I hope that nobody will get angry because of this post, I just mean that we are all equal - no matter what we are fighting with. If you've managed to quit anything that was bad for you, be proud of yourself. Had to get this off my chest."

addiction,Hydronome,2020/4/1,"Internet and Social Media Addiction In the recent months, I've begun developing the thought that I may be addicted to the internet, specifically social media. My new phone has the ability to track and display my screen time and how much is associated with which app, and I noticed that my daily screen time is around 2-6 hours. Not only that, but I usually have a feeling of disappointment in myself after having a long spout of scrolling through Reddit or watching YouTube or Twitch (a live-streaming website) videos for an hour or two. Additionally, I started to notice that I have urges to just sit down and go on these sites.

Most recently, I thought to myself, this may be an actual problem. Whenever I've brought it up to people in the past, like my parents, I usually get responses like ""It's okay to relax and decompress every now and then."" and ""You're too hard on yourself."" For a while, I believed those things because they have some backing. I am hard on myself at times, I work very hard, and I tend to set high standards and expectations for myself. However, what's making me question that reasoning now are the signs I mentioned in the previous paragraph. I don't think the screen time I take up, the feelings of self-disappointment, and the urges are simply due to me not relaxing. In fact, I think that I¡¯ve been going on the internet as an unhealthy way to ""relax.""

For years, I've always felt bad about myself when I spend time on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit, and I've always had this vision in my head of a life in which I don¡¯t use these things for entertainment. Instead, I¡¯ve always wanted to be able to find the same levels of happiness and relaxation by doing things that are productive (exercise, meditation, playing an instrument, doing work, reading, etc.). I understand that it is possible to use social media in moderation and that many people do it, but it is very difficult for me. I can lose track of time while on these sites/apps. Maybe I do hold very high standards for myself, but my gut is telling me this is an issue. I¡¯ve been feeling this way so much recently that I decided to take an entire week off of the sites/apps I¡¯ve identified as being addicted to, cold turkey. It¡¯s been a couple days, and it¡¯s pretty difficult. I¡¯ve been feeling a lot more anxious than usual (I¡¯ve always had anxiety, but not at this level since I was in college.), and I¡¯m beginning to question my methodology. That's ultimately what brings me here to this subreddit, a question I've had on my mind for a while now: **Can the internet and social media be considered a legitimate addiction, and should I treat it as such? I know there are methodologies for treating addictions, and I¡¯m wondering how applicable they can be to what I am trying to change about myself with my internet use.** Social media addiction is rarely mentioned as much as drug addiction, and I feel like so many of us are just sweeping its existence under the rug because of how common and novel it is. I understand that drugs are very different from social media in the sense that the internet is a tool common to everyone that can be used for productive activities, whereas that¡¯s not the case for most hard drugs that people struggle with (plus hard drugs can have much more severe effects on someone in a shorter amount of time). That being the case, it¡¯s not easy to find legitimate, scientifically backed resources on how to work through something like this.

So what do you all think? What¡¯s your opinion on this? Is anyone experiencing something similar? Are there any good resources I can check out to help guide me? The idea of treating this as a legitimate addiction is new to me, so I¡¯m still trying to wrap my head around it and figure out where I go from here."

I maintain my GPA and extracurriculars at a highly ranked university, but the main thing that has been bugging me lately has been my dependence on substances to make it through the day. Like a lot of people my age I unfortunately have an nicotene addiction, but I also smoke every night along with a glass of wine or two or three. During the day to feel confident I usually drink vodka and will even attend my classes drunk, but no one ever seems to notice. As well, I take adderall almost daily (unperscribed) and spend the weekends using other things such as acid or shrooms. Somehow I have a way of justifying all these things in my mind by saying that it is ok because I mainly use at night or in social gatherings etc. Deep down I know that what I am experiencing is not normal though and I know I am putting a strain on my body. I nearly lost my father to alcoholism and painkillers multiple times as a child so I have seen first hand the effects. I just can¡¯t wrap my mind around the fact that I am so dependent on all these things, but partially I feel like I cannot function without them and cutting everything out at once seems too difficult (besides weed because i have no intention of giving that up just yet).

addiction,cutiecarol,2020/4/13,"Will rehab convince my boyfriend to break up with me? Hi everyone! This is my first reddit post ever. Today has been a really awesome day. My boyfriend of almost three years has finally agreed to check himself into a rehab facility for his cocaine addiction. I am SO relieved and he actually seems sort of excited about it which is awesome. We made the call to the facility together this morning and I've been on cloud 9 ever since. I started doing some more research on my own (googling stuff like ""how to be a supportive girlfriend while my boyfriend is in rehab"" and ""what relationship changes should I expect after rehab"", etc) and I happened upon a topic that made me a bit uneasy... 

There seems to be a common trend of people being ""brainwashed"" into ending their current relationships while in rehab. I know that this is an INCREDIBLY selfish thing for me to even be worried about right now, obviously my top priority is making sure my boyfriend is healthy and safe and alive. But this still has me a bit worried. I love my boyfriend very much, we talk about marriage often, and aside from his drug use I think we have a very healthy relationship. I would be so crushed if he came out of rehab and suddenly didn't want to be with me anymore because some counselor had put that thought in his head. I understand that part of recovery involves avoiding certain triggers, and that addicts are often encouraged to end toxic friendships and get rid of possessions that remind them of drug use, so if he truly needed to break up with me because being with me reminded him of cocaine then of course I'd be willing to make that sacrifice. But oh boy would it hurt. 

So is it true that this is a common part of recovery? Are addicts really encouraged to end romantic relationships, even healthy, supportive ones? Any advice would be appreciated, thank you so much for taking the time to read this."

addiction,Dynastistic9211,2020/3/17,"I am addicted to masturbating and I do not know how to stop 20 M here from the United States. 

I have come to this subreddit to ask for guidance for my addiction problem. I am absolutely addicted to masturbating (and perhaps porn as well). I naturally discovered masturbation when I was probably 4 years old, but I did not realize that it was masturbation until I was almost in middle school. Once I hit puberty, I was jacking it maybe once a day, more or less. At the time, it feels amazing and natural, but afterwards, there is an element of shame and dissatisfaction that lingers.

Although I am 20 and feel that my time with puberty is soon coming to an end if it hasn't already, I cannot help but feel that my amusement with masturbating is still very high, and I did not realize that it was an addiction until a few months ago. Here is a list of some reasons why I realized it was addiction:

1. I would skip important events, risk being late for school/classes (I'm in college), accidentally skip time to be with friends for the sake of masturbating (I enjoy lengthy sessions)
2. I would risk being caught by family members and roommates to an extreme degree (to this day surprisingly I have never been caught with dick in hand)
3. I would actually pay money (which I do not have a lot of) towards my desires (sex toys, porn memberships, Snapchat premiums)
4. I have a girlfriend as well, and although we have refused to engage in intercourse until marriage, we still engage in sexual activities in other ways, which for me, usually involves handjobs and fellatio. Sorry for the graphic image, but I think this is important because she is technically giving me masturbation, and I fear for this because I believe that it deteriorates my libido for actual intercourse. The positions that we do during this is always the same and we have done this a LOT. So much so that it is starting to become difficult for me to maintain an erection if I am not in a certain position. 
5. Although I still love my girlfriend very much, I know masturbation can have disastrous consequences long-term on romantic relationships, which I very much would like to preserve.
6. I lose/waste SO much time masturbating that I lose sleep. I will masturbate for around 2+ hours a session. Not because I cannot climax, but because I will edge myself continuously until I feel that it is the right time to finish.

Every time I am about to masturbate, I tell myself, ""This is the last time and then it's done."" But it's never the last time. I'll make other excuses, for example, since I'm currently on spring break, I could say ""Since I'm home doing nothing, and it's more difficult for me to masturbate in a college dorm, I should jack off as much as possible while I am at home and get it all out of my system so that I am satisfied when I return to college"", but the problem is that I believe this is what reinforced my addiction to begin with. It's also reached a point that as soon as I see something lewd or sexual, maybe on TV or in person, I have to make some time within the rest of the day to masturbate. There are some days when I can manage to not masturbate, however, but there are others where it can reach up to 4 times. These days, the common amount is twice a day. 

I do not know what to do. I thought I could beat this on my own because I find this subject kind of disturbing and embarrassing, but I am running out of options. I hate this addiction, and although it's one of the best experiences when doing it, there has never been a session where I did not feel disappointed in myself afterwards, especially now that I know what I am doing is contributing to my addiction. Any thoughts or ideas or guidance would be beyond appreciated."
addiction,Verdoofd,2020/2/26,"Looking for Dutch people who are addicted Hi all,

Recently I started working as a researcher for a series of documentaries about addiction for the Dutch public broadcasting (NPO3). That's why I'm looking for people who are addicted, or who recently stopped using.

We intend to follow a few people for several months, so we can (hopefully) give viewers a deeper understanding of what addiction actually means. Why do you choose to use, again and again, even when you don't intend to? And why is it so hard to stay sober?

In the end the viewer (hopefully) gets a personal insight in the lives of several people, and their relentless drive to numb themselves. The documentaries should present an unprejudiced representation of people who are addicted. We want to show that addicts are also plain people, although their lives sometimes maybe seems to be different.With these documentaries we hope to nuance the general knowledge about addiction, and to fight stigmatization.

The coming two months we are researching. We will try to speak with as many people as we can, to get a better idea of what is happening right now. So right now I'm just curious about your stories. The first contacts will stay private.

If you want to know more about these documentaries, or when you want to contact me, you can send me a PM."

Been battling with various addictions for years so I decided to knock them all on the head for 2020 due to declining physical health and concerns about my own mental health. Quit alcohol and cocaine just before Christmas and I quit weed about 5 weeks ago. Stopped smoking cigarettes a week after that and dropped my antidepressants about 2-3 weeks ago entirely, after tapering off them for a couple of months. So I knew that I was going to be bombarded with withdrawal symptoms and have a pretty shitty start to the year.

It has been going better than I expected, withdrawal symptoms have been very real and it has been difficult, but each thing I quit gave me a bit more strength to move on to the next item on the list. However, in the last week or so, I've noticed that I am extremely angry and have a short fuse with family and friends in addition to some pretty heavy anxiety. Trying to hold it together but I am struggling, my mental clarity has become extremely poor again and my productivity is non-existent.

addiction,CleanRich01,2020/2/20,"Society Blows!!! I know that overcoming addiction requires taking full accountability for the choice to become addicted to something, and I do take complete responsibility.  However, I find myself becoming increasingly enraged by a modern society (particularly in the West) that encourages, almost worships, being addicted to things.  Don¡¯t get me wrong, commit a crime under the influence and you go to jail, your mug shot gets uploaded to the web, and people condemn you.  But addiction itself has simply become a way of being.  High functioning addicts are simply accepted.  It isn¡¯t until your life ends up in the gutter that people tell you, ¡°maybe you should get some help.¡±  I went to university, where everyone partied on Wednesday nights and on the Weekends.  It was just what people did (unless you were serious about a career, that is).  Everyone was also addicted to caffeine.  Borderline sex addiction, under the mask of sex positivity and empowerment, also has become the college way.  Don¡¯t take this as a knock on sexual freedom or me telling anyone how they should manage their sex life.  I have no right to do that, no desire to do that...I won¡¯t do that.  But if you are having multiple one night stands, having sex with a different person more than once a week, or as many times as every other day, you really ought to think about whether that is healthy.  Again, I do not think I have a right to tell anyone what to do.  I simply think that there is a bitter irony in our obsession on staying thin when we spend every minute of every day being hooked on something.  Not only are we hooked on substances (and also making marijuana legal; that is a whole other can of worms), but we are hooked on behaviors too.  Pop music is now addictive (music producers deliberately use ¡°hooks¡± that provide hits to the reward centers in our brain).  Social media is addictive.  The internet is addictive.

Is there a second of our day where we aren¡¯t getting hits from something?

I don¡¯t think it is possible NOT to get hits.  I think that our brain is wired with a reward center that makes sure we are motivated to eat, procreate, and get things done.  Our reward center is what inspires us to learn new things, to read, to partake in creative endeavors.  Without our reward center we would hardly be human at all.

Indeed, one of the best ways to overcome addictions, is ironically, to hook your reward center to more healthy alternatives, like meditation, exercise, or a creative hobby.

What angers me is that society continues (and will continue to) endorse the most dangerous kinds of addiction, simply to make a buck.  It seems that no one cares about this until it is too late.  And no one pays attention to anyone who calls this out.  We are considered party poopers, or eccentrics.

addiction,earnestpeabody,2020/2/13,"Google Play gambling apps... I contacted Google Play support today asking if it was possible to do a self-exclusion ban from gambling apps for a set period of time or permanently. 

They said this was a ""good idea"" but not currently possible and that I should submit it as an idea through their feedback mechanism. 

This pissed me off, but also gave me a nudge of motivation to push them to put this feature in and I submitted the feedback saying how i thought adding self-exclusion would be in line with their Code of Conduct policy. My plan is to send the feedback once a day and keep at it over time. 

It may sound like a bit of a downer, but I don't have high hopes that they'll make the change. I think there is too much money in it for them and for the app developers. However, I still feel like it's a worthwhile thing to do. I feel like some good will come of the effort even if google do nothing.

My friend who I am no longer around or really in contact with recently texted me and said they had been abusing Xanax for the past few years. I had a feeling something was wrong because the last few years their personality changed and they treated me terribly. Based on their behavior, I'm assuming it was the past 2-3 years. They told me that they are ""no longer using it"". My question is, can they really be sober from abusing an anxiety medication that is highly addictive without rehab or the help of a doctor?

I work in the medical field, and from my understanding, don't you need to be weaned off of the pills or at least be in a rehab program to do so? It just seems so unlikely that after years of use you could just miraculously be sober?

They don¡¯t produce the same magic they once did but I still cannot stop. This started after a life changing event that caused me to go into a sort of self preservation mode. I found solitude in high doses of doctor prescribed benzodiazepines before ultimately overdosing resulting in my doctor ceasing the prescription. This led to the most pain I¡¯d ever endured, the benzo withdrawals, and then deciding to stay sober. With a few months of sobriety and the pain of the aforementioned life changing event remaining unsolved I made the decision to try my cousins adderall after reading about the effects online. From the very first time taking the two blue pills (10mg tablets) I fell into an abusive love story that I have tried to separate from thrice. My final attempt at quitting lasted 6 months before convincing myself that I now contained the self control to only use on occasion. That led to using no more than twice a week, then no more than four times a week, and now I find myself fighting a horrific war everyday as I try to talk myself out of taking another, and another, and another. At its peak I was using between 200-300mg of adderall per day depending on the daily events and using over a gram of cannabis shatter a day which which resulted in an overdose before my most recent attempt to quit. Now here I stand having lost my self control again and am using between 50-80mg of Dexedrine a day and still using cannabis but significantly less frequently as I¡¯ve found I become delusional and hallucinate when I use too much cannabis. Please help. I can¡¯t go to family as they all think I am clean (it¡¯s helps that I¡¯m extremely high functioning and am a software engineer) and I have a sibling who is a heroin addict that my family is always worried about so adding my addiction to their burden is not an option.

I have OCD so I have a hard time making friends and going out to social events which feeds my never ending pain of being so alone.

addiction,hwillieyams,2020/3/6,"Should I hang out with my old drinking buddy? Hi r/addiction,

Seeking some advice. In college, \[friend\] and I were best friends. Though it wasn't the only thing we bonded over, alcohol was a major component of our times together. Looking back, much of this was 'problem drinking,' (binges, blackouts, etc.) but the feeling was 'hey, it's college.'

Toward the end of college, I had a series of epiphanies that (thankfully) steered me toward the path of self-care. Today, I drink infrequently and in moderation. \[Friend\] experienced no such reorientation; if anything, he doubled down, 'came to terms with' being an alcoholic, and I believe has now picked up a coke and cigarette habit to boot. We drifted apart pretty rapidly after college, due in part I think to me not wanting to party like I used to, though there are other factors at play too (physical distance, \[friend\]'s general psychological journey).

I want to reconnect with \[friend\]. He is a special person and means a lot to me. Also, if possible, I want to support him turning away from his self-destructive lifestyle. I feel partially responsible, given that I played a great part in ramping up these behaviors then stepped off the train when I'd had enough. Given his current lifestyle and our past together, I can't imagine a way to spend non-awkward quality time together without drinking. He would likely be drinking, so if I abstain, it will feel pointed and judgemental. But drinking with him would feel irresponsible, given that drinking is an addiction for him. Yet I know social isolation and/or being surrounded only by other users can play a major part in continuing an addiction. I'm wondering now if the benefits of reconnection, of reminding him that he has a friend and a safe space in me, outweigh the harms of drinking (in moderation) with him. After all, he's drinking anyway, with or without me. It's possible he will never stop drinking; does this mean I have to never again experience our friendship? Yes, of course, if our friendship is real we should be able to have it without alcohol; but I don't think he's ready for that at this point. Having a nice time together seems like the best way back into his heart, the only way I see to help him take the first step toward health.

Thoughts? Thanks in advance. &lt;3"

addiction,GlisteningConspiracy,2020/2/15,"Not sure where to go next My partner is addicted to coke, and without going into a whole history of his life, he started smoking weed as teenager to cope mentally with an abusive and broken childhood. We've been together since teenagers and are now in our 30's with 2 kids and a house. Its only in the last few years that the addiction has escalated into an issue. He's always used something weed/coke/alcohol/pills etc but its always been in a way that can be explained as casual. Although, I believe the addiction has always been there. I've been supporting him about 4 years, with him only admitting and trying to deal with the addiction properly the last 2 years.

I'm someone who copes quite well with stress and can generally keep my cool, but the selfish behaviour has really driven me to a place where i'm just lost as to what I can do. He's very open about his issues and has made steps to get better e.g. couselling/drug support groups/anti depressants (spent about 6 months sober last year), but this swings so widly. I really struggle with certain decisions that are made that put him straight on the route to getting drugs. Plus money is a massive issue, He knows he can't be trusted with it so I manage it and often have to lie to him about whether or not we have money. But then obviously theres only so much of that I can do, as it becomes obvious we have money when we go to buy food/petrol etc.

We've sat down and discussed boundaries before but at the moment he's in such a bad place, none of that is being met. So much money has been spent that we are way into an overdraft and can't really afford even the essentials until we get paid. It may be hard to believe but despite the money and addiction issue we actually have a really great relationship and when he's out of actively using he's a completely different person.

I'm not really sure what I'm looking for, other than maybe some words of support, perhaps if you have any hope for me/or you think I'm clearly blinded by the situation. I don't want to just give up on him, so much of what he went through as a child is really quite unbelievable and he's always sort of been abandoned. The problem is its affecting me significantly now. I have recently developed quite high anxiety and panic attacks. I'm not sleeping and over the last few weeks have come out with a stress rash and have a constant twitchy eye!

I don't really confide in anyone close to me with the details, as they don't truely understand addiction and would automatically pit him as the bad guy and suggest breaking up with him as the only option. I get that may be the case, I'm just hoping someone can give me some unjudgemental options as to what I should be doing.

addiction,BandicootSVK,2020/2/9,"Got rid of nicotine addiction, and my mother In my country (Slovakia) it?s legal to buy alcohol and nicotine products if you?re 18+. I was a smoker since I was 17 (my older friends bought me cigs), and when I was 18, I bought vape, and stopped smoking. Over the years, I managed to get my nicotine from 18 mg/ml (nicotine ammount of about 4 and 1/2 packs, 20 cigs each) down to 0. At various points during high school, I also battled alcohol addiction, and I was able to get rid of it as well. But now, for the last two weeks, I?ve been vaping on 0 nicotine, and it affects my mood. 

My mom thinks that I?m on some sort of drug, and wants me to get drug tests, or else I?d get kicked out of here. For fuck?s sake, I?m just 19, and my mother wants to kick me out, because I?m fighting my nicotine addiction! She didn?t even believe me that I was a vaper, and kept telling me to get tested for drugs. 

I told her that I don?t have money for drugs, and I don?t know people who?d have them (even through my physical and personality traits mark me as someone, who gets easily addicted). I have only some online friends, and my LDR girlfriend, I don?t even leave this fucking appartment! I told her that it?s a waste of time, since I?m just going to waste money on doing test that will show her that I?m only having withdrawal symptoms from nicotine addiction, WHICH I ALREADY TOLD HER ABOUT.

And then she turned the entire debate into how I?m disrespecting her, how I?m not grateful that she sacraficed her entire life, how she became a single mother just to take care of my sister, and blah blah blah, you know the shit that divorced mothers say everytime they throw a temper tantrum. I know she had a hard life, and I?m grateful for everything she had done for us, but fuck you mom for thinking that everyone is trying to hurt you and that you are always right, no exceptions.

My boyfriend relapsed on cocaine that turned into a three day binge, during these past three days he has lied to me nonstop. This relapse has cause him to be hospitalised at the semi-intensive care section because of the amount of sedatives they need to use.

It isn¡¯t something new as this has happened in periods during our entire relationship (we have been together for about a year and a half). However, it¡¯s only the second time he¡¯s been hospitalised due to a relapse during our relationship. But as far as I know, the total count of him being hospitalised because of his addiction is over 10 times, the lengths of the stays has been variant.

The reason I¡¯m considering waiting to visit him to the after tomorrow, is because he¡¯s going to rehab for three months and that means I¡¯m going to stay in his apartment (I used to live there with him, but due to making our relationship healthier I¡¯m living with my grandparents till I find my own place and only spend my weekends with him) taking care of our cat that current lives there. I don¡¯t have any friends in that town, I pretty much only know my in-laws. I¡¯m trying to prepare myself for lonely months, I was informed it was going to be a three months stay a few hours before he was taken to the hospital because of his mental state. He will be leaving Tuesday for rehab which is also sooner that excepted.

I¡¯m really conflicted about whether I should visit him tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. He will be sleeping pretty much all day for the next few days and not remembering much (if pretty much everything) as long as he¡¯s sedated.  
I¡¯m conflicted because; I¡¯ll like to have one more day with my beloved and wonderful grandparents because I won¡¯t be able to visit them very often and I¡¯d like to not rush packing the things I need But it¡¯s also my duty to be there for him and support him when going through this...

addiction,ivegotanxiety,2020/3/22,"Possibly Important Thought Something a lot of people don't think about, is the difference between addicted and dependent. One who's addicted to something, that's within the mind. It's a chemical imbalance solely. On the other hand, being dependent means that your body requires it or you're going to start having possibly fatal withdrawals because of it. I'm addicted to coke, ice, and H (although, H seems rather infrequent these days.) But I've developed a physical dependence, yet. Important to consider whether someone's addicted, or physically dependent. If one of your loved ones is addicted to something, it's likely that they're missing something else in life. It could be missing the sense of achievement, sense of family or community, anything. That's something you could work to fix if you're close to them. Being physically dependent on the other hand, is a matter of willpower and outside help, ex. clinics and suboxone.

Even before this ""rockstar lifestyle"" started, I daily smoked weed for two years and take atleast every 7 days one or two lsd trips for about 1 year now.
I guess that's not too bad, but since this constant traveling started alcohol, mdma and cocaine joined.

Because nearly every show is a party and has also an aftershowparty we or me can basicly party on every occasion with free booze and rich people wanting to give you cocaine because they liked our show.

I've gone along with that and this means I sometimes drink and snort every day and take mdma maybe every week for two or three tablets.

Idk it just doesn't feel right and I started worrying about my health and how long I can do this, because I feel quite good actually.

But with social media and games, it's so different. It's so easy to pick up when you're at home and have nothing to do for an hour, fast forward a month and I'm neglecting my friends hobbies and responsibilities to progress in a game, or I rather scroll through Facebook for an hour just to ""not do"" some important stuff.
I know it's dopamine related, all games nowadays are total dopamine IVs, once you start everything else feels bland and boring, and you don't progress fast enough to keep you interested. So even if I play a bit, slowly but surely I get into the game and other stuff fades to the background.
When I think of quitting cold turkey I feel immense anxiety that I will feel bored forever, but I feel guilty after spending yet another day on the bad habit.

I don¡¯t even know why. I was diagnosed with ADD (also having CPTSD, but realized it last year) and took it several years without being addicted- more like the opposite. 
And now I can¡¯t stop taking too much even though it makes me feel worse and I know it. And it¡¯s not even making me feel high, or like a having a lot of energy, never did. Every time I read about students using it to stay awake or have more energy or stuff like that, I get kinda jealous because in my case it made me clean up my room when I first got it prescribed. 
And then it teared down many layers of dissociation, false beliefs and illusions I had to create during my life to cope with the traumatic experiences I experienced in my family and school. 

But now it became the only controllable instance in my life and the irony is, I can¡¯t even control it. It feels more like a psychological addiction, because I get extremely afraid, when I don¡¯t take it. It feels like a frame that brings me somehow through the day. 
Before that it was binging food, and other things that are still haunting me, like skin picking, binge watching and now smoking.

It got even worse and I am terrified that all the trauma and stuff that came up when I started the medication , even though I used it correctly except the past two years, is all my fault due to abusing the medication. 
It doesn¡¯t even make me feel good and it¡¯s like I am addicted to destroy myself, but I¡¯d rather torture me with that, than to sit and wait for what is trying to overwhelm me when I don¡¯t run away. 

I am ashamed, I feel like trash and that everything is my fault and nothing ever happened to me and I just got crazy because of substance abuse. 
I want to disappear and hide and run away from my existence. I can¡¯t endure what I try to avoid so much that I use this as means of escape. 

I feel too close to the core of my anxiety that I feel like I go mad when I don¡¯t try to escape or dissociate. 
It feels like I am dissolving and falling uncontrollable without something to hold on to. No safety no secure ground, I would rather die than to feel this because I can¡¯t imagine something more horrific than to feel this solitude, abandonment, pain, darkness, panic and deadly terror.

addiction,_ThrowawayAccount_-,2020/4/20,"Online Gambling Addiction On my 16th birthday, I was given $100 by my family members to enjoy my freedom and do whatever I wished with this money.  Your imagination takes control of you and clouds your logical thinking. Regardless I went to a bitcoin atm in my nearby area to find out you had to be over 18, I was extremely disappointed. I then bought a $100 amazon gift card and traded it for bitcoin on [localbitcoins.com](https://localbitcoins.com/). For some reason, I had a mindset where I knew I could get scammed but had an all or nothing mentality which should have been a warning sign for further reckless behavior.  I was watching videos learning more about the technology and somehow stumbled upon a video that showed a site called bitsler where you could instantly deposit and win crypto. I watched a video where this guy seamlessly deposited a similar amount that I had and won $8000 within minutes. I deposited my money and became a sucker that day. I just kept doubling up after every loss and chased losses. I lost patience with small bets and strategies. I ended up winning 20 litecoins which was over $1000 and I was shocked. I instantly withdrew them to my own wallet, knowing full well that they would be returning to the site later after the rush I received. The next night those litecoins were once again being gambled, now I had a more exaggerated fantasy of my possible winnings. I thought I was some genius who would bet a large amount on black after many consecutive reds, I was so overconfident I probably would have claimed it as being skill rather than luck. I get jittery even thinking about my previous bets, losing 15 litecoins on a 50% bet. I was so desensitized by the ""number on the screen"" rather than actual cash. Of course, I doubled up losing bets and got lucky. I remember my heart beating so fast and my hands shaking typing in chat before I went all-in with 93 litecoins all or nothing on 2.1x payout. Parents sitting in the room 20 feet away completely unaware of what I am doing.... starting an unhealthy addiction and unrealistic perception of digital money and gambling. I don't know whether it was good or bad that I won that bet. Sometimes I wish I had just lost it all here. At the time I won litecoin was around $60 a piece. I would always consider not going to my job paying $13/hr because I just made a week's worth of pay in 10 minutes, it was like having an unimaginable ""superpower"" of being able to double your money. Being 16 and having \~60,000 in digital cash is a surreal feeling but also a feeling associated with the dreaded burning a hole in the wallet phenomenon. I was tempted to buy stuff but my stubborn overconfidence in luck told me to double that again and again. There were some nights where I would deposit $100 lose and then get mad and deposit $5000 and bet all in. I would think about how much I just won and it would fulfill my self-esteem. At the time of my gambling, I was very isolated and didn't go out with friends much and winning made me feel as if I had some worth. I will never forget these highs and lows of gambling and have not told my parents, nor do they have any clue. Hindsight is me thinking about the potential \~$60k I could have made but obviously that's no point in reminiscing on. I realized I wasn't gambling for the monetary gain but rather entertainment, reassurance to my ego and most important adrenaline. I am glad this experience happened while I was young and that I have time to recover. I am now in college and have saved money from my past 4 years working and am in a comfortable position to avoid debt. I have been free of gambling for over two years and have come back now to share my story that I was too scared to share earlier in my journey.

The house always wins."

Shortly after moving in with him I found out that although he is still in treatment for the opiates, he is taking Ritalin recreationally and I am starting to suspect Cocaine.

addiction,ThePenitentSquid,2020/4/1,"Spouse has cocaine addiction and I don't know what to do Hi, not really sure if I¡¯m posting this to the right place, but here goes I guess.  


After finding our small, but growing household savings/quarantine safety net wiped out, I confronted my spouse who continuously denied knowing about it until finally telling me that he spent it on drugs, specifically dabs and coke.  We have had many issues over the years with him keeping drug use behind my back.  A few months back I found out that our rent was 2 months behind, after having believed he had paid it.  He said then that he had actually spent it at the casino and on weed.  I am hesitant to believe that any was spent at the casino, not that it really even matters.  I told him I didn¡¯t want him spending money without me knowing about it, and I had asked him to stop smoking weed, as this had been a financial and dependency issue for many years.  He had kept coke use from me for over a year before I finally found his (empty) stash of it and called him out, to which he admitted using it, but that it had been ¡°only a couple times¡±.  Recently, I had been suspecting he was using again, and I asked him, telling him I that I didn¡¯t want to fight, but that I wanted to help him, and he told me I had nothing to worry about, that he wasn¡¯t using, but appreciated the sentiment.  He said the words ¡°I hope you don¡¯t think I¡¯m a drug addict or something.¡±  Well today I found out that he spent over a thousand dollars over the last few months and he finally admitted that he¡¯s got an addiction problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of this post I guess is just me venting, but I have some questions too.  How can I move past this, how can I learn to trust him again, while he tries to get better?  The denial and lies stretch out weeks and months before I finally get him to tell me the truth, by which point things are much deeper than they had initially been.  How do I trust that he is actually putting in effort to overcome this?  He expressed that he never pictured that he would be in this position, and that he¡¯s not proud of it, and I believe all of that, but how can I trust that he won¡¯t hide this from me again?  I¡¯ve been supportive of him from the beginning to the point that I feel like I¡¯m just being used now.  I don¡¯t feel that he respects me.  I love him and we have a life together, kids together, and I know life could be so much better.  I don¡¯t want to leave him, but this is taking such a massive toll on my mental health, and I am feeling so overwhelmed with it all, that I sometimes feel like my only chance at any sense of normalcy is leaving.  What can I do to help him overcome this and save this relationship?"

I am a 26 years old male, i work for a multinational company in the industry I always wanted to work in and I have another job which includes journalism and other things I really enjoy. I get paid very well compared to people in my country, especially in my age, but I have zero savings and in fact I have some credit card debt, which is still manageable and doesn't cause problems, but I always have the feeling that my whole life/career is on a razor's edge. I have never really talked about it to anyone yet, since I don't want their picture of me to break.  
I have been smoking weed since I was 15 and in the last 10 years I smoked weed every day with really rare exceptions. It never caused a problem for me, nor does it now but is part of the whole picture.   
1,5 half years ago my girlfriend broke up with me after 7 years for another guy and since then I started doing cocaine.   
After the breakup I had some coke at least 4 days a week for a few months but after a few months things got better from this point of view. But something changed last autumn and since then I did not have a week without cocaine and sometimes I do it on workdays too.   
I spend way too much money on it and the another problem is that I like doing it alone. Right now I am laying on my couch after I snorted a line I bought just for myself to feel better.  
I perform really well in my jobs and I always make end meet sometimes, even though I know that there is a thin line between me, a high functioning drug addict and having real problems caused by my habits. I say every Sunday that the next week will be different but after a few days I feel like coke is the only thing that could make me feel better. I am a bit depressed since that breakup and somehow I can't feel okay with myself without doing it.   


Does someone else have this kind of problem?

addiction,No-Way-AA,2020/4/3,"Alcoholics Anonymous is Bio Hazard. Today on the Zoom App.

&amp;#x200B;

The good old AA members kept blocking me and kicking me out of the zoom online meetings.

Mostly because I put forward positions and information that the brain-washed cannot deal with...

Liek the stats on the AA relapse rate, the churn rate were 50% of newcomers are gone within 3 months and at the end of every year there are only 5% of the newcomers left..... 

When you ask, ""Why does AA have such a stupendous failure rate? And what are you people in the groups and service structure doing to promote the ""unpalatability"" of the membership of AA, and to reverse it?

They have no answers.

Warfare breaks out.  So with my 43 years of being around AA - I am no push over to the bullshit and I will and do hammer these people when they try it on.  ""We serve up our clubby crap to him and expect to get away with it, and he wipes the floor with everyone in the group. Tsk, Tsk, Tsk - we have better boot him from the online meetings"".

So I launch this into their chat rooms.

&amp;#x200B;

The AA failure rate - how much of this is due to AA being the worst performing of all treatments (George Valiant - AA trustee conducted university trials - look them up) and people just not willing to put in the effort to deal with ALL their issues - not just alcohol?

For every 10,000 welcome to NA / AA chips are bought by the groups, only ONE 20 years drug free medallion is bought. What happened to the the other 9,999 people? I did the global research on the issue 10 years ago, and had it published here. [https://www.orange-papers.org/orange-effectiveness.html](https://www.orange-papers.org/orange-effectiveness.html) If you don't believe me, ask your area / national office for their sales figures.

Of course the dickheads in this meeting will screech ""You can't say that"" - ""Well I can, and I have, and what I say is true. It's been 41 years, 10 months and 17 days since I made the decision to stop using. And all the vitriolic fuckwits that will denounce me and kick me from the group - You are the ones, who are going to become the ones, who are going to die using. LOL - Your the 9,999, out of the 10,000 who were not prepared to do what it takes to get to 20 years drug free.

""Oh boot him! boot him from the meeting"".... they screech.

Well the intolerance of people who convey information based upon fact, and the unwillingness to make the most of the opportunity when it comes your way, AND the unwillingness to do anything other than talk shit instead of putting in the hard work - that's where the 9,999 relapsers out of the 10,000 come from.

In all my years, NOT one of you ever have the humility and scincerity to ask, ""What do I have to do, to stay drug free, deal with all my issues, one day at a time, for the rest of my life?"" - To me, almost all of the people here, are just talkers of shit.  The clubby, crawly, incrowd....

Gods special education team - totally intolerant of any opinion, other than their own.

Get on the phone, and ask your regional offices for a copy of their medallion sales figures for the last 10 years....

It's not the absolute accuracy that is the issue, it's the gaping chasm between 10,000 welcome to AA / NA keytags, being sold to the groups, for every ONE 20 years drug free medallion....

So for everyone of me, there are like 100,000 who have sailed themselves into the garbage bins of life.....

To me, your loser retarded opinons, do not count for anything.

The majority of people in AA freely give me their disapproval....

Haaaaaaaa Haaaaaaa Haaaaaa The majority of the Gossiping, Retarded Arsehole, LOSERS in AA relapse......

You bring your relapses upon yourselves and your bring it upon each other....

AA is in serious decline... I saw the trustees report that they alluded to the fact that because the insurance companies are no longer paying for the rehab revolving doors, not enough fresh members are being recruited by the AA cultists, to make up for the churn rate and relapse rate of AA, and without enough unpaid workers to make all the literature sales to the newcomers, who then do not become more unpaid workers, AA is facing insolvency. AA is becoming bankrupt.

So for the most part, your all going to die using."

He is on a number of prescription medications, and has been on many over the years, I can't even begin to name them all but mostly related to depression, anxiety, sleep aids. I was surprised recently to learn he is now on lithium as well.

He abuses these drugs. He mixes and matches them, he overdoses on them. When his doctor won't prescribe he'll just buy them from other countries and abuse them. The drugs make him like a zombie. He's had one incident after another where he's passed out in public or crashed his car due to driving in a complete haze, he comes to and can't even remember how he got there.

He's had therapists, psychiatrists, he's been to a short-term in-treatment facility. I don't know what's next. I really worry about his survival, he's endangered his life many times (unclear if intentional or not) and is clearly on this destructive path. Even when everything seems to be going good/improving we'll suddenly find out he was taken to a hospital after taking 8 sleeping pills and passing out in a McDonalds.  I don't even understand what's going through his head -- I always hear about opioid or amphetamine addiction but this type of abuse seems so different (though maybe it's not). I worry about his life and don't know what we can do to help.

Anyone that can help explain, tell me where to look/read, point me to stories of recovery from this type of addiction... anything would help!"

I¡¯ve been with my boyfriend almost a year now and recently found out he had been stealing my adhd medication from me for about 8 months of our relationship. Once I found out, I decided to tell his parents. We separated for about a week but eventually decided to work things out. He promised to get clean, however he still smokes weed every single day. I know he shouldn¡¯t even be doing that, but he has severe depression and social anxiety and it seems to help him out (except sometimes I wish he wouldn¡¯t abuse it as much as he does). He finally got a job and everything seems to be great, except something seems a little off. 

He works 3 days out of the week and has to be up by 3 am in order to get to work on time. These last couple of weeks I notice when he wakes up he brings his travel bag into the bathroom with him in the mornings when he is getting ready. This bag also goes with him to work because he brings extra clothes and stuff to work. I have also noticed after about 10-15 minutes of him being in the bathroom getting ready for work he starts sniffling excessively...way more than usual (he¡¯s had a constant sinus/allergy thing that¡¯s been lingering on for months but it seems much worse on the mornings he works and suddenly after he¡¯s been in the bathroom for a while). 

I¡¯ve tried checking the bag once, but I was rushed and nervous he would walk in and notice me snooping. I don¡¯t want to be caught snooping and then be wrong about my suspicions. 

What should I do? What other signs can I be on the look out for? I hope I¡¯m wrong, but everything in me says I¡¯m not...especially now that he is making really good money and has the means to fund his addiction."
addiction,braveContrarian,2020/3/23,"I disagree with the definition of the 'addiction disorder' I believe addiction is not a single overarching disorder but much more complex than current medical science and neurology accept.  


for one i dont believe it is a lifetime illness that 'never goes away' either -- i think what 'never goes away' is a sort of mental inclination along with potentially other non-treatable (or poorly treated with modern psychiatric drugs) mental illness that lead to the enduring desire to go back and re-experience or use again.  


however i would say that not only does addiction end with post withdrawal -- that once someone is free of constant urge and withdrawal they are no longer addicted -- but that each individual drug has a unique addiction syndrome and is NOT related to other addictions regardless of the fact that certain reward centers of the brain are held in common.  


this explains why each drug user has a different DOC, why actually one can use their DOC again and quit immediately (though this is not advised and is a risk, it does NOT ALWAYS end in re-addiction and i have proven this personally. its anecdotal, because I AM THE test subject and the test holder, but its true, just unlikely and a serious risk because if you believe that you 'can get away with it' and do it again and again you get yourself back into the cycle.  


this cycle is not created by addiction tho -- its a mental inclination for the reward which endures. the feeling. I would say that each drug you experience this differently, and depending on your state of being mentally, either affects or does not.  


for example i could smoke crack every day for 10 years and suddenly stop, feel better in 3 days and move on like nothing happened. other drugs tho this may not be the case for me.  


this is because my personal set of mental disabilities and struggles lends to the benefit mentally of one specific type of drug over all others -- because it helps. the urge to get help is mainly the drive here.  


so its a set of disorders, multiple disorders, that cannot be treated the same or considered the same. treating people addicted to sex, the same as video games or crack or heroin or PCP is not going to work. each one is unique and characterized by different symptoms and root causes.  


the only success ive had staying off drugs has been outside of AA and NA, denying the supposed definition of addiction and acting alone. Ive done everything they say not to (use drugs to quit drugs in substitution, deny the supposed research, continue use of alcohol on a limited basis etc)  


and im 100% fine. not an alcoholic, not a problem usually. Im one of the 1/1000000 who actually had enough willpower and intelligence, with tons of years of struggling, to actually make it work.  


and even if it is insane odds for a person to make it work. the fact that i have proves something. if im not onto something, then i shouldve failed.  


but im not on maintenance. i dont take anything. i dont go to meetings.  What they say works didnt work at all and what they say couldnt work worked wonders.  


its tough though. ive tried to advise others on my quit method. most of them abuse the quit drugs and never stop getting high. it requires absolute strength of will, high intelligence and great wisdom. you also need godlike willpower.  


if you arent prepared to be tortured in war and not give up information to the enemy, you dont have enough willpower.  


but on in a million will die before talking. so if you will then you can do it. you just have to masochistically suffer for about 6 months to a year."
addiction,Qwerv9,2020/2/3,"Feeling absolutely terrible I've had a serious drug problem since I was about 15 years old, started as being really interested in psychedelics but that quickly turned into complete fascination with all types of drugs. I feel like for the past 5 years drugs have just been my life and I've not been able to focus on anything else. My first major problem started with benzo abuse as I started ordering etizolam from the clearnet and quickly fell in love with benzos as I felt like they turned me into a social god, which is a great feeling for me as I'm quite a shy/introverted guy by default.

I became seriously hooked on benzos at 17/18 and was doing shit tons of them, usually mixed with opiates too like heroin or morphine. It's really crazy that I'm still alive and I still feel some derealisation because how the f can I have survived all the times nodding out on midazolam/oxy etc when I was probably 2 missed breaths away from dying. I spent my 18th birthday being resuscitated from a heroin/xanax overdose and it's such a shameful, disturbing memory.

Recently though, I've been to rehab and am actually sort of getting things on track. I'm about 3 months clean from all benzos and opiates although I did have a small relapse on opiates a few weeks ago. 

The problem is, another devil has popped up now. Cocaine. The place where I live in the UK is fucking packed to the brim with cocaine and nearly everyone I know does it. Every weekend is the same, I go out for 'a couple of drinks' and come home at 8 in the morning having spent all the money in my bank account and am completely depressed for about a week after.

It's time for me to stop this shit before it gets a lot worse. I'm going to have to stop drinking alcohol completely as I can't psychically drink alcohol without getting insane coke cravings.

addiction,alwaysstaysthesame,2020/3/31,"Quitting Cocaine ¨C Some Questions Hey there. I'm hoping some of you that are further along might help me out with a lot of doubts I have.

My boyfriend is trying to quit cocaine, which he's been doing on a rather regular basis for about the last year and a half. The last three months have been really bad. He's been taking some practically every day, with some breaks of one of maximum two days in between. I wasn't around for about a month and he's only now started to open up about how big the addiction is. After I 'caught' him doing some last Thursday, he came to the conclusion that only big measures would have an effect. He factory reseted his phone to get rid of the phone numbers that were on it (you can't delete them). I now have sole access to his Google Account, again because you can't delete contacts without there being an option of recovering them. With the lockdowns in place, getting anything without a number is going to be difficult; we're also always around each other.

He's four days in and feeling absolutely terrible with intense cravings. Now he's thinking that quitting cold turkey is impossible, also because he's not feeling on top of stuff with work because he is feeling so restless and can't focus. He thinks that easing off cocaine would be better, with larger gaps of time in between ¨C essentially getting some tonight after four days, then some next week after a break of seven etc. It sounds to me like he has intense cravings and desperately wants it, regardless of what would be best, but I've got no experience in it. The only drug I've ever done is MDMA, so it is difficult to relate to how he is feeling.

1. Is easing off the drug better than going cold turkey? I imagine it takes much more self-control.
2. Another idea that came up is taking MDMA on the weekend (we have some left) to take his thoughts off coke when he's feeling particularly antsy. He heard it can help with quitting cocaine as well. He's never had any addiction problems with MDMA, but I fear that taking any type of drug might make him want to take another as well. I'm also personally not too keen on taking it now (would have preferred to wait another three months or so), but I'd be into it if it could be of help. He also came up with that idea before feeling miserable and is now less interested in it, so I'm inclined to think that it's more than just an idea born from a craving.

addiction,chatooly,2020/3/3,"life gets worse every time i light another bowl (meth) just ran out of my last batch, i promised myself this is the end &amp; i¡¯m quitting this time so i smashed my pipe (which was hard to get because i¡¯m 17) but it¡¯s only been a few hours since i sobered up and everything¡¯s hitting me all at once, it¡¯s been 4 months straight so it might be a little early until withdrawals kick in but i¡¯m already coming down and it feels worse every single time i run out like i always just felt ok about it at first but the more times i¡¯ve ran out and couldn¡¯t afford more i just kept getting anxious anticipating how it¡¯s going to make me sleep all day and i don¡¯t want to just feel so physically defeated n slowly emerge into my old n depressed self who so stupidly sought after meth to feel better in the first place. i know it¡¯s stupid as hell for me to use it as an antidote for depression cause that¡¯s already enough of an excuse to want it everyday, let alone just being flat out addicted to it, like yeah it¡¯s bad getting over addictions physically but mentally my depression has worsened and now, i have trauma additionally to that because what meth made my boyfriend become and other situations i¡¯ve been around because of that drug. oh, yeah, i kind of got my boyfriend addicted too lol. but that leads to what i really wanted to say in the first place: it¡¯s horrible feeling responsible for someone you would die for slowly killing themself and/or losing themselves mentally, completely discarding everyone they used to be and someone you don¡¯t recognize instead. i even mean it when i say they switch up their whole personality. it¡¯s like one second he was himself and the person i just was always used to n right at that moment, my boyfriend literally morphed into a hateful n mean and really fucking cruel person i didn¡¯t recognize. and by morph i mean i saw his whole facial structure change in a scary supernatural way. i genuinely was scared for my life seeing him physically change like that, even before he started being hurtful to me. it¡¯s different for everyone, but i assure you everyone who smokes meth regularly starts to lose touch with themself, like your ego and your identity or general idea of who you really were. i promise you if you don¡¯t think it¡¯s true you¡¯re wrong because i felt the same way until i realized i was approaching situations, talking, acting just so out character. it¡¯s not really until you¡¯re sober that you realize how much you thought u were getting away with. i promise you everybody knows too. as hard as you try u will not be able to act like how u would sober around anyone, and maybe they aren¡¯t too sure what it is, but they¡¯ll definitely know you¡¯re doing drugs and doing them continuously. just seeing how different you are can really weird someone out depending on how close they are or your relationship. i easily recognized my bf change as soon as i was scared shitless just seeing his face morph into one i not only didn¡¯t recognize but felt so afraid of without even knowing why or what happened. he insisted it was his real self that he hid from me, and i really didn¡¯t want to accept that since he was a super optimistic n caring &amp; loving and for some reason an innocent type of a guy to me. i was so heart broken by the whole situation, just not being able to unsee that side to him. i genuinely never expected it. i cried in front of him for the first time and very hysterically because i felt extremely fucking hurt by what he said and did to me that day, but partially blamed myself because i figured meth made him become like that and it was my fault he did it in the first place. but essentially i¡¯m responsible for him starting meth and all the symptoms that come along with it since i introduced it into his life. but at the same time i pay the price for it since he emotionally, mentally, and a few times but never too heinously physically abuses me everyday. that¡¯s another thing i won¡¯t get into, but let¡¯s just say that evil side he morphed into never went away. dealing with that alone is super hurtful especially when it hasn¡¯t stopped for months and it¡¯s a vicious and continuous cycle that won¡¯t stop until i stop. the most painful part of all this though is knowing i have to leave him and leave him in this state hoping things change for him since i can¡¯t handle the abuse myself and put up with it for over 2 months letting myself feel trapped with someone i used to love but now feel so hurt by that i am now internalizing ways i could let him go as gently as i can, but letting him go forever."

WHAT I HAVE LEARNED (thus far)

1.

anger is not sustainable (you cannot sustain (active) anger over long periods of time. it is exhausting, will make you physically, mentally and worst yet, spiritually sick.) it can also weaken your resolve in abstaining from substances.


2.

?? a.?? argumentation is a skill, being argumentative is a sign/red flag

??? b.?? a sign/red flag is much like an old fashioned theatre marquee flashing ""UNSTABLE""


3.

you can deflect, deny, filibuster, accuse, attack, obstruct and continue to act out,? fearfully... but it won't change what the Truth is.

ultimately however, we make our own decisions and thusly are responsible for each and every one of them.

deflection promotes the disease of addiction whereas self reflection and introspection promotes wellness in all areas of life.


4.

(struggling with) spirituality/belief system ~ burning bushes *rarely* happen... even in the bible.

because HP (a higher power,  greater thank you) sometimes speaks in whispers, we must listen... in order to receive, learn, practice and pass on to another, we must truly be quiet and listen.

quiet your mind, your heart... let your spirit settle... and Listen. Learn. Live, and Live Well.

Can't order it to any of my friends house as I don't have many friends or anyone willing to do that. So basically I'm just fucked.

addiction,swishatwistaa,2020/2/6,"Ibogaine Experience I took ibogaine in Mexico. I just wanted to explain my experience and hear your feed back. I highly recommend this miraculous medicine to anyone struggling with addiction. I was in a small clinic/hospital when I initially took the medicine (message me if you would like a reccomendation). There was one other person with me laying in the bed next to me. There's soft instrumental music playing and a projection of lights onto the ceiling as a light show just for amusement before we traveled out of our bodies. We took the initial dose two pills and waited twenty minutes until taking one more following another one after twenty more minutes. Right after taking the last pill I look over to my partner and ask if he feels anything he responds to me that he is unsure and raises his hand and puts it back down and at that moment his hand trailed in very slow motion. His hand had reached the bed but my vision was still catching up knowing then it was coming on and very fast and intense. I watch the lights in the ceiling as they are turning I see an African mans face come and go the face with tribal patterns would keep coming up eventually I decide to close my eyes and am thrown into this very speedy space with portals surrounding me in every direction I entered each portal each one seeing videos. Burning futuristic buildings in one. Myself robbing people and people deceiving me for money. One with homeless children begging me for help as I ignore them and continue to walk on. One where everyone I knew was watching me slam dope and crying in front of me. In each portal before I would leave i would experience feelings of near death. My thoughts are racing and the images come to me at a million miles an house although it wasn't just images. In each portal I was overwhelmed by each of these feelings: fear, greed, selfishness, shame, and anger. When experiencing all of this it feels like an intense buzzing and computer chip is plugged into your mind. My experience with visuals lasted about 10 hours and after that it was still lasting effects such as overwhelming feelings and information flooding my mind for another 3 days very slowly coming down I was unable to stand  for about 24 hours until after ibogaine and did not get any sleep for 80 hours after dose. After sleeping I did take DMT and did not experience any visuals just a release of all the fear I had inside of me. The ibogaine tore me apart and the DMT put me all back together. Most beautiful experience with 5MEO DMT this is a must after iboagine
 
Although I had a very dark intense trip with ibogaine it was crucial to intrupt my addiction. Through all the tribulation I learned about my fears by facing them. The feelings of being near death symbolized a death to my fear shame selfishness greed and anger. This has been the best experience I have ever had. Do not be scared of this medicine it's a strange thing we are scared of ourself and the truth. Don't keep turning your heads and looking away from the beautiful life in front of you addiction Rob's you of every previous thing but there is hope and there is light at the end of every dark tunel"

addiction,anxious-princess,2020/1/25,"What do I do about my parents meth addiction? Hello folks,

I'm not sure if this is the right place to post but I'm feeling quite desperate. Since before I was born my parents have been struggling with a meth addiction, however when I was about 3 they stopped as it was impinging on their care for me (I never found out till I was 17). Ever since I have left home, I've found out that they've been taking meth on and off in my life  and ever since I left home at 18, they've openly been taking meth because they think they can ""manage it"" responsibly. Ever since I left home, they have been trying to cope with the breakdown of their own relationship as well as Empty Nest Syndrome (they believe I ran away from them even though I needed to leave for Uni. We used to be really close together as I'm an only child, I really looked up to them like my best friends). 

Now throughout my life they treated me excellently, except for one thing: if I did something wrong, they would always place me at the expectations of an adult and get ridiculously aggressive. We would have 4 hour rows about how I told a secret about someones crush in grade 5, and I was never one to put up a fight and I would listen to what my parents say, even though they continued to drum into me how awful of a person and verbally beat me down till I'm in a puddle of tears. I believe arguments like these have contributed to the reason I have massive anxiety about my character and moral upstanding today. Without my parents to judge me, I am constantly policing myself and verbally berating me in my own head to punish my action that wasn't even really that bad. Whenever they do find out something I'm doing wrong, they still use the same tactic, or instead take a passive aggressive negging approach. Since I've left, I finally thought it was time to stand up to them and tell them that they can't treat me like this, but that was met with shouting and blaming me for being a bad daughter. 

After visiting their house for the month on Christmas, I can see just how bad things really are with their habit. They don't eat properly at all, it's all junk food when my mum is a chef. They go to bed at ridiculous hours and sleep for ungodly hours. When they are awake they are yelling at each other and calling each other cunts. Me and my boyfriend have been forced to watch and counsel their arguments, and after attempting to leave and give them space they cry to be begging to help them. As a daughter who hates seeing them in pain and wants to help them I tried my best. However seeing them fight everyday for 4 weeks took a toll on my own mental health, and when we went to see my BFs family for NY it was a breath of fresh air. I didn't want to return to my parents, however I had to for an appointment they had organised for me with their world class anxiety specialist doctor friend. The catch though was that this workshop was to be held at my house. The thought of going back to that house triggered all my anxiety. So I politely told them in a message that I didn't want to go back and that with your love and support I think I can manage my anxiety just for the moment as I'm not ready to return to the house just yet. 

They called me up to tell me that I've embarrassed and hurt my father deeply and that I was bad miserable company on the holidays. For them to try and turn what happened on the holidays on me blew my mouth agape. I was so shocked that when they told me to not come back to the house in the call, I said ""fine, I will. Fuck you"" and hung up, which is something I've never said to my parents as I respect them so much. They continued to text me about how I'm a bad person, an ungrateful spoiled brat who will be a bum who drops out of uni (makes no sense as I'm doing very well at Uni), and that my boyfriend is manipulating me and an emotionally abusive partner because I stood up to them. I asked for one day of space from them and they went crazy at that too saying that as a family we have never taken space from an argument. After my one day of space I said I was ready to resolve this. They didn't contact me in 3 weeks, and when they did it was to tell me that they weren't speaking to me until I apologise. I said that I'm not going to unless you do for all the nasty shit you said about me and BF, and also get your shit together in your own aggressive lifestyle. They proceeded to call me deluded, a cunt, and when I finally brought up it's the meth addiction that's doing this, they said ""We know what we're doing kid we've been doing this for 20+ years and it has nothing to do with anything. Also you're a hypocrite because you're pothead lowlife scum"". I think the addiction has everything to do with everything. Their life is not balanced in the slightest and while we were staying there they would buy a packet of meth at least once every weekend or two. I know they are taking it to cope with their problems. But they don't want to admit that. Before we said our final goodbyes I told them I loved them very much, but they accused me of being compassionless. Mum started to cry and tell me that they are here for me and they are ""sorry for everything they did"" and that they love me too, then hung up. I'm starting to think she said that to guilt me because whenever I bring up a problem especially with them, they always incite me as the criminal in the situation, and that whatever they did just wasn't as bad as what I did. 

I feel like my heart has been shredded. I've been constantly battling that maybe I should forgive them because they are family, but then nothing will change. I've been battling that maybe I really am the bad guy and I've always been the bad unappreciative guy that doesn't deserve them. I'm completely willing to say sorry about standing up the appointment, I know that was inconvenient and even said that in my message, but I don't think it warranted all that aggression and personal hurt when they could have been diplomatic and asked me why I didn't want to come down or ease my mind about coming down. 

The worst thing is that I feel like I can't tell anyone. I want to help them, I want them to get help so bad but I feel like if I told my grandparents about it my parents would hate me forever for it. They'd hate me even more if I told my mum's sister since they hate each other and aren't even speaking. I dont know what the goal of this post is, I'm so very sorry, but I just feel so emotionally low and kind of abandoned by my parents. I dont know what I should do, I dont want them to be hurt. I've condensed things massively but this is the gist of my situation, I guess I am just seeking some outside counsel. I'm waiting to see a psych about all this soon but now that I feel essentially like I've broken up with my parents and my 20th birthday is tomorrow, I just feel incredibly sad. How do I help them if they won't accept they have a problem? Thank you for reading."

addiction,Mayyyyonaise,2020/3/16,"I'm addicted to prescription amphetamines and it's slowly killing me Hello all, I need help and don't know who to turn to. Sorry for the long wall of text, just have a lot to get off my chest. 

I got prescribed Vyvanse for ADHD 2 years ago with great initial success. Like many who have used this medication, I started at 30mg and my life instantly changed for the better. I lost weight, improved my grades, and pretty much got all my shit together. I was in love with the high it gave me and the increased motivation. I felt unstoppable and falsely believed that the feelings I was experiencing would continue every day for the rest of my life. 

Eventually I slowly started upping my dosages and persuading my doctor that I needed more for it to remain effective. I am now prescribed 70mg (maximum prescribed dosage) and more recently in the past month I have been taking 140+mg every day. I don't want to take this much but I feel compelled to when I wake up in the morning and even if I overcome the initial urge and just take 70mg I end up taking more later in the day anyway as a booster because 70mg doesn't get me high anymore. I'm addicted to the rush of vyvanse, caffeine, and nicotine and it's hurting my cardiovascular health and my sleep patterns. I've been going to bed late and waking up early to take more because I keep thinking that if I take a big dose super early in the morning, I'll finally be tired by the time I should be in bed, but it never happens. 

As recently as one month ago I exercised regularly, maintained a healthy diet, and enjoyed a vibrant social life, but as of late I've started working from home and going out to socialize less and less, prioritizing getting high over exercise and socialization. With the corona quarantines in place in my city, I can't even go to the office to escape my living room because it's closed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been having major chest pains and sleeping problems this past week. I'm living a very sedentary lifestyle due to that fact that I am currently recovering from the flu, which I think I got in the first place from lack of sleep and lack of self care. As a result, I do not get tired enough to sleep well at night. I'm also worried about exercising at a high dose and hurting my heart even further. The vyvanse suppresses my appetite so much at this point that I'm also getting inadequate nutrition. I want to stop, but I'm worried I cannot maintain school/ the life I've built for myself without it.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently see a therapist and have talked to her about this but we go weeks inbetween meetings and I struggle to implement self-improvement strategies. What do I do? My health is declining rapidly and I'm in pain :( I'm worried that the part of me which wants to quit will cave in tomorrow morning and take another 140mg."

One solution to addiction is connection. I think a lot of addictions are allowed to fester because of a lack of social connection and social accountability.

Yo! I'm an addict, you're an addict. I work remotely, maybe you do too. Suppose you, a couple others, and I were to all form a group inside a large house in some random area in Italy / Spain / Singapore.

We'll hash out what we believe to be the root causes of our addictions and model paths to fix ourselves. This way we understand each-other and become socially accountable for our actions and whether they follow what our (occasionally rational) selves believe in.
I'll call you out on your bullshit, you'll call me out on mine.
Working together, cooking and eating together, doing outdoor activities together. These should form the basis of a successful, clean lifestyle.

After the 90/120 day period is up, we can decide what to do after that, it'll most likely be a return to our previous endeavours in life, except with completely revitalized mindsets.

I (M 21) have a friend (F 21) who recently went to rehab and got clean from heroin, coke, and anything else she could find.

She's smoking weed almost every day, and occasionally binge drinking and dropping acid. In her defense, she's in intensive DBT, has an addiction therapist, med compliant, etc. 

She keeps trying to talk about making amends and helping her explain to people that things are different now and I just... can't do that to those people when I know it's not true. It's like she believes she crossed this magic threshold of sobriety and now she's a totally different person, but the same patterns are there, just toned down.

addiction,Dan78757,2020/3/22,"Getting by as an addict in the time of Coronavirus ""The opposite of addiction isn't sobriety.  The opposite of addiction is connection"".

This is one of the many sayings that we addicts know by heart, but this one has always hit home with me because I know that deep down my addiction soothes me because I am lonely and feel unworthy of the rest of the world.  Whenever I reflect on my acting out behavior I ultimately know that I'm trying to fill a hole in myself that can only be filled by connecting with other humans. My vice isn't important, because no matter if it's drugs or alcohol or sex or gambling or food we are all throwing it into the hole that can only be filled by connecting with others and learning to love who we are unconditionally. 

Over the last few weeks the reality of Coronavirus has hit home.  I've been acting out more, but the disturbing part is that I've been excusing my acting out due to Coronavirus.  The reason I've allowed these excuses to become a part of my life is because I've suddenly been told that I'm no longer to have that which I know can help me.  I cannot connect with my brothers and sisters in meetings.  I cannot connect with my family.  And I am not allowed to find new people to connect with.  As responsible people we have to ""social distance"" so that we can all stay safe.  But ""social distancing"" is just a fancy word for isolate.  And any addict worth their salt knows that isolation is the exact behavior we have to avoid if we are going to stay sober.  It is our road to hell, paved with good intentions.

I don't have an answer for this.  I just want all the other addicts out there who are suffering under these conditions to know that I'm thinking of you and that you don't suffer alone.  We have the tools to make it through this, and we will come out stronger in our sobriety.  Our addiction does not own us, and it will not make this any easier.  Please be safe and stay strong and lets all make it out the other side.  I don't know you, but if you understand what I'm taking about and can relate I love you.

Best of luck to you all and please take care of each other."
addiction,sleepy_moody,2020/1/2,"Seeking Advice Hi,

My Mother has been an alcoholic off and on my entire life. She lives with my Dad and younger brother currently. I live in the city far away. During my visit over the holidays I have discovered that my Mother's physical health is starting to decline more rapidly after a back surgery in October. I also discovered that she hasn't been stopped from drinking a minimum 3 large cans of beer a day. This in combination with her insane smoking habits, and lack of overall of physical activity caused by her depression and anxiety is sending her on a downward spiral with her health.

I've tried to reason with her many times over the years to varying levels of success but she has always gone back. I know this battle never ends and I accept that. My question now is it morally okay for me, as well as talking my brother and Dad into taking away any alcohol she gets ahold of, and ruin any cigarettes she finds in order to try and preserve whatever health she has left? They live in a small town and I have considered calling all taxi services in our town to try an enact a ""No Deliveries"" list for our home address, this is to prevent her from getting things delivered to the house while my brother and Dad our at their jobs during the day.

It genuinely feels like the alcoholism has such a strong grasp that this is one of the only courses of action left. My brother has left the house to live on his own for periods of time and has told her it's because of the drinking, which did not stop her and continues on with statements like ""It's my life."" or ""I know my own body and I'm fine."" The Doctor and Nurses have told us multiple times her health is very poor for her age.

Any input is welcome, and thank you. It feels like this is the right thing to do, but I just want to make sure."
addiction,Alarmed_Anywhere,2020/3/29,"Relationships &amp; addiction I (27F) have a current bf (30M) who¡¯s an addict. We¡¯ve been together less than a year, but we¡¯re really compatible with each other, and we have similar personalities. However, he relapsed in September, got it together and then relapsed again last night. I have struggled with pills and coke in the past (5ish years ago), but managed to stop. He has multiple addictions, but this time it was crack, meth, and IV opioids. I am stable in my job, continuing my education, and just generally have my shit together. He just recently got a job after months of unemployment due to his last relapse. During this time, I supported us financially, and he incurred debt (~$1000) under one of my accounts that I had to pay back on my own to keep my credit score as high as it is. He has paid me back a portion ($400), but keeps asking to borrow $20 here, $30 there, which adds up to around $800. He¡¯s been through a lot personally, custody and exgf issues, which I was there for him during, always hoping it will get better and the relationship won¡¯t be so one-sided. This time, I did my best to comfort him when he was coming down, but I honestly don¡¯t know if I can keep doing this, because seeing him like this is breaking my heart. I keep waiting and waiting for it to get better, and it hasn¡¯t, and I¡¯m starting to lose hope. I¡¯m not sure if it¡¯s worth staying anymore. 

I know that it¡¯s my relationship and you can¡¯t tell me whether to stay or leave, but I guess I¡¯m just looking for perspective from other people¡¯s situations. Did it get better, did leaving help either person in your relationship, or did staying help either person?"
addiction,fitifitifitifiti,2020/4/10,"Not sure what¡¯s the point of this Hi everyone! Not sure how to start, but I just got out of an extremely abusive relationship and unfortunately weed has been (and still is) my only ¡®coping mechanism¡¯. It started in January, so it¡¯s been more than a year, and only increased in severity because of increasing trauma and pain. Where am I rn is, I don¡¯t think I have spent more than 2 hours sober the past two months, with the exception of a couple of days where I had to go to work. I can¡¯t deal with the pain and anger I¡¯m feeling, I can¡¯t deal with thoughts and constant flashbacks. It also helps me with eating, otherwise I feel like someone is force feeding me and sometimes just throw up after eating. My typical day starts with me waking up, immediately smoking (since the thoughts are immediately there too) until I pass out. And then wake up and repeat. Most of the times I would wake up at like 4 am with terrible stomach pain and nausea and throw up literally nothing, would dry heave to a point where my back muscles are cramped and almost grovel back to my bed in shivers so I can smoke myself to oblivion again. This is pretty much my life for at least 4-5 months, with fluctuating severity, but this is a very accurate description for Feb and March. And April seems to be the same. First it was just day smoking and watching the same stupid tv series over and over again to distract myself instead of going to work, then I would stop for a couple of days because I would also get some ¡®support¡¯ from my ex who was pretty much my only friend and family, also the only person who knew I smoked (tho he never took it as an actual problem) until he does something to hurt me and it would be back to weed. I didn¡¯t see a pattern back then because there were ¡®good days¡¯ in between and I was still somehow able meet my responsibilities and be okay, but now everyday is the same and I feel so disappointed when I wake up to a new day, because I have to exist. I honestly don¡¯t know how I¡¯m still employed because I have been just cancelling things, coming up with excuses and not meeting any of my deadlines. Whenever I am done with the weed I have, I tell myself I¡¯m gonna take at least a week off but within an hour or two I find myself going to the bank so I can withdraw money to buy more. And then back to my bed, the same cycle starts again. Anyway, sorry for the extremely long rant, I guess this isn¡¯t even ¡®technically¡¯ addiction but more of an abuse, but I figured this page might be the right place to post and maybe to learn something from. Sorry if this was not the right place post and you wasted time reading this. Stay strong and take care everyone!"

addiction,guiga199,2020/2/5,"Is Genetic Addiction Risk Score Test (GARS) legit? Hi all. I remember that I learned, in one of my biology classes in high school, about a genetic test that could predict whether or not you are genetically inclined towards developing addiction - being it for alcohol, tobacco, food, sex, etc. Back then I didn't care much about it, but now, years later, I decided that, if such a test indeed exists, I would like to do it. In the process of looking for it online, I found out about a test called Genetic Addiction Risk Score Test, which I assumed to be the one about which I learned. However, I couldn't find any anecdotal evidence about it. With that being said, I would like to know if there is anyone here who has done this Genetic Addiction Risk Score Test and what you think about it. Is it legit? Is it worth almost $300? I guess that if it works, I wouldn't mind paying for it since this would definitely help me to better arrange my life and live better in general. The question is: does it really work?

For additional information, the company whose test I was considering taking is called GENEUS."

addiction,A_Real_Phoenix,2020/3/25,"If you can't get your usual drugs because of the epidemic and might have to go through withdrawal, please read this! Hi there! I'm really concerned that a lot of people won't be able to get their usual drugs due to the coronavirus and might die because they don't understand just how serious withdrawal can be. I've already seen a lot of posts on this subreddit dismissing or making light of withdrawal. Please, read this with an open mind.

Withdrawal isn't a joke. We all know it's really unpleasant to say the least, but a lot of the time it's very dangerous and can be completely lethal. To the best of my knowledge serious alcohol, benzo and opioid withdrawal are all able to kill people. Even if your body doesn't just shut down you could still die through other means, such as seizures. I read a comment about someone who had a seizure from withdrawal, bit their own tongue off and almost choked to death. The mental health effects of withdrawal can be equally dangerous.

*Explanation of tolerance and withdrawal ahead*

I'm studying neuroscience and while I'm no expert on this stuff I think I can explain it at least in a simple manner. This of tolerance and withdrawal this way: Your body and brain works to maintain healthy conditions for proper function. We call this homeostasis. When you constantly drink or drug your body this becomes your body's new perceived normal conditions and over time your body and brain adapts to these changes. It does its best to try and get back to homeostasis in these new conditions, and makes changed to work towards this. The thing is that these changed take time to happen, and when you suddenly stop taking drugs or drinking your body and brain can't change back instantly. Suddenly they'll be working as if they're still under the influence of drugs or alcohol, but there won't be any substances in effect. These changed that your body and brain have made are really dangerous when you're not at least somewhat drugged or drunk and quitting cold turkey or abruptly can absolutely kill people with serious alcohol or certain substance dependencies. Your body needs more time to slowly adjust back to the way things were before you started regularly taking the drug or drinking, and so you have to taper off and decrease your dose over time to get back to normal safely. It isn't safe to self medicate and it should really be done with the help of a medical professional.

*Explanation over*

If your going to run out of benzos, opioids or alcohol I'd really recommend you see a medical professional. Trust me, if you live anywhere decent it will be part of their job to not be judgemental and to help you as best they can. I imagine people in the medical industry would just be happy you made the leap to reach out and get help. You are just as deserving of medical help as anyone else, and addiction is a completely valid illness that people shouldn't try to take on by themselves ? If you're at risk of dangerous withdrawal, please, make the leap and get treated. It would make me and I'm sure many others very happy if you did. At the very least, it's worth a shot. Worst case if you get medical help? You go through withdrawal is a comfortable, safe, supportive and controlled setting and you are probably weaned off with clinically administered drugs, with support against the pains of withdrawal. Worst case if you go through serious withdrawal on your own? You die. 

It can be difficult, I know. But please, take the leap and accept help through these hard times. The world would be a darker place without you in it. You are a wonderful and beautiful person and you can absolutely make it through anything that life throws at you! So please, if you're going to go through serious withdrawal, don't go through it alone ???"
addiction,notsofunson,2020/4/1,"Helping Others (Long Post) Possibly Part 1 Hey, world of Reddit,

I have long had the idea in my head to write a blog about my problems with addiction, and how in the end I managed to overcome them. Since I was not entirely sure of how to go about this and with my end goal of getting some things off my chest and helping others I thought this would be a good place to start.

It all started with alcohol, I wish I could tell 23 years old me how much alcohol would be a gateway to the next almost 8 years of my life and how it would begin a struggle and personal battle which at some points I was not even sure I was involved in. 

Some background I had recently moved country (Germany to spain) and found myself living in a new culture as a scuba instructor one which involved hanging out with our students every day after work and as the Spanish do drinking a lot of beers, 1 beer a day soon turned into 4 and then 6. But everything was fine right?. I remember once counting and it was 120+ days in a row I had drunk 4 or more beers. Did i realize i had a problem **no.**

From there, things started to escalate I started taking what I considered to be party drugs and I suppose believed that this was not really a problem, everyone else in the club taking ecstasy and cocaine somehow validated my actions and made them explainable to myself.

This then leads to a three-year slippery downslope were my once a month party night became tri-weekly and eventually getting to the lowest 6 months of my life at which point I dread to think the number of weeks that passed when I was taking 6 - 10g of cocaine per week and most worryingly working as normal pretending everything was okay and being able to function whilst heavily sleep deprived and under the effects of all of these drugs.

To free myself from my own personal hell I ended my relationship of 3 years, changed my entire friendship group and tried to get professional help. In the end, I quit my job and moved to a completely different part of the country.

I'm now 8 months clean, and somehow feel like I'm on the road to recovery. I'm happy to answer any questions anyone has and hope someone reading this might find it helpful in someway."
addiction,cosilence,2020/4/15,"Manifesto It's been clear through the recurrent relapses that it takes a miracle to heal from bad habits. That under the mystic spells of habits it becomes hard to stay conscious, to the point vision is blurred on the subject own behavior and motivations. And the single most important thing is forgotten. 

It now stands clear to me, there is no other more important thing than relating to other in a way that motivates them to bring their best to the surface and to enjoy life together for long.  Keeping calm is key, subordinating all mystic whims to the major goal of living fully through taking back what habits took us away, freedom. 

No choice, no freedom. If you can't choose you're not free. No freedom, no responsibility. If you are not free you won't feel responsible for what happened. But the real beauty of life is in being able to dome our mystic habits and once they are our servants, enjoying them fully. The natural way."
addiction,TrueStorey1776,2020/2/22,"I need to help my sister but I don¡¯t know how Last summer my family and I slowly came to the realization that my younger sister (30) was probably using crystal meth. It started when she asked our father to help her inspect her electrical outlets and light fixtures for hidden cameras and fiber optic cables. He didn¡¯t know has to deal with the situation and ended up playing along with the inspection. Then a few weeks later our mother was visiting her (our parents have been split since she was born and they don¡¯t speak so she didn¡¯t know about the outlet ordeal). M noticed S was looking around her house almost desperately while M and her boyfriend were sitting on the couch with my niece (3). M¡¯s boyfriend noticed he had sit on something and then realized it was a bag with what he told me later looked like icy crystals. M inexplicably gave the bag to S and asked her about it. S deflected and nothing else was said about it. When I eventually get these two stories from my parents I started working to bring my parents together to plan an intervention. This took too long and S¡¯s situation worsened. Before we could do the intervention S was found by police on the side of the road after she had pulled over on some out of the way county road. She had her daughter in her car seat and was passed out in the driver seat. The deputy said that it was clear they had been sitting there a while and that it was around 5 am when he showed up. The result was felony child endangerment, resisting arrest and some other charges I don¡¯t fully recall. Human services gets involved and the baby is taken and put into the car of my father and step mother. That happened in July and my sister still has not faced those charges in court and my dad still has temporary custody, so at least the child is safe. 

Since then we have all tried to talk to S about rehab and getting help but she has refused and denied everything since day one. According to her she has never been on drugs and the whole thing is a big conspiracy against her. Any time I talk to her on the phone she will act like everything is completely normal in her life until I bring up these issues and she will start to accuse me of being an imposter pretending to be her brother. The entire situation is hard to confront. To top it off she divorced her husband one month after the arrest and is now homeless. Several family members including cousins have tried taking her in and one even got her a job at the nursing home she works at. But she failed the pee test. Of course that too was a conspiracy and the administer of the test tampered with it. She has burned many bridges and is sitting in county jail right now for contempt of court in a completely different charge unrelated to the original arrest. She has been in there a week now because this time the bail bondsman won¡¯t even get out because she skipped on her last bond. I feel horrible making her sit in jail because I know that county jail is a horrible place to have to sober up and that there are no programs in place to help these inmates beyond the bare minimum. The problem is if I get her out of jail I know she still won¡¯t go to rehab. Right now the plan is to let her stay in jail for a month or so before any of us go visit. Then we will offer to get her out if she will sign herself into treatment. I don¡¯t know if this is the right thing or not, but it¡¯s the only thing I can think to do at this point. I could really use some advice on this."
addiction,StrugglingButDecent,2020/1/20,"Trouble quitting Adderall So I will try to keep this short.... 

I was prescribed adderall around a year ago, and I 100 percent abused it like crazy.

I'm trying to be honest with myself about having an addictive mindset, and I can't tell whether or not I'm just lying to myself to make myself feel better. I've recently started to get into Blackjack, and after a couple of months of studying, I've been able to keep a pretty strict schedule as far as winning or losing. So far I'm up a good amount, but my visits to the casino have also gone from 1-2 times a month, to 1-2 times a week, to 3-4 times a week. Some of it has to do with the fact that I'm winning (I set out an amount for the year, and if I dip below it, I'm done until next year), but I'm wondering if I'm just taking this a step too far... I feel like because I'm winning, it's justifying going so often, and I wonder if that's the start of a problem. I'm trying to see if this can become a career, so I'm sort of treating it like that as far as the time I'm putting in to leaning my craft, but again, I'm just wondering if this is starting to become a problem. 

Is the fact that I'm setting hard limits for myself enough of an indication that I don't have a problem? At what point does this become a problem, outside of simply ""betting too much money""? What are some indication that this is becoming a problem if I keep winning at the pace I have been? It's like... just because I win/I'm not losing money I don't have, doesn't mean a problem isn't forming, right?

I guess I'm just trying to figure out what some warming signs to look out for are. I'm wondering if my ""system"" is just a justification for a growing problem, or if it's showing that I do have the ability to let limits, thus showing that I have this under control...

I'm sorry if I'm not explaining myself clearly, just let me know if there are some more details I can share to get a clearer answer."

But sometimes I feel like it¡¯s getting outta hand. Like yes I¡¯m prescribed, but nowadays I catch myself taking them throughout the day due to boredom, if I¡¯m being completely honest. 

I¡¯ve never gotten to the point of overdosing, but it has gotten to the point where I¡¯m functioning all day, every day on bars. If I¡¯m not on bars, I get bored and feel like something is mentally missing. 
I can¡¯t tell if this would be considered a substance abuse problem or if I¡¯d be considered an addict. I¡¯ve come to this realization a while ago, but would really like some support or advice as to helping me figure out if this could potentially end up being a bigger problem.

addiction,MyHeartIsWarm,2020/4/4,"Tips For Fetish Recovery? Hello everyone, I decided to also post my story in this subreddit because I think people here could help me. If you have time in your heart, would you guys and girls be willing to help me find creative solutions to fight off a sex adicition? Or at least, what is left of the addiction. I still battle hard every day.
This is the story:

I am autistic so it is a little bit hard to express my feelings,
Humor is very important and as a comedian I understand that we people use it all the time however this post is hard to do so I appreciate constructive comments please :)

I had a conversation with a professional sex counselor this week about eradicating my fetishes.

So I repress my sexuality a lot, and I think you will understand and even agree with me after reading a few examples from my list.

I can not accept my fetishism because I dont want to, here is why:

&amp;#x200B;

(Long Story Short)

When I was little I always liked to place things between my legs and somehow a vacuum cleaner hose (not the nozzle)

ended up there. I liked the feeling as a child and because of my ASD spectrum condition I got obsessed with

the feeling and hoses thus collected them in puberty.

The fetish finally developed in getting horny from vacuum cleaner sound, smell and just the hose in general the most.

When I was about 11 I was also on the internet a lot searching for vacuum videos and I stumbled upon ladies vacuuming

in high heels and I got a huge fetish for feet n certain high heels also.

Fetishes in itself and sex are things that I do not necessarily view as bad or negative at all, but I view them rationally.

I have not really found a use that is beneficial to me for years and that is somewhat tiring.

Here are some of the experiences I had in the past to give you all a context of what I am talking about:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Vacuum cleaner hoses are almost everywhere so the horny stimuli is too high for me if I dont fight it.

\-My thoughts were running wild thinking about sexy woman and how the inside of their vacuum hose would smell and al similar kind of stuff would make me ejaculate a little.

\-Even somtimes the dust was a turn on.

\-The fetish is also very precise, when some things arent right in setting I cant even get an erection (for example from a ridgeless vacuum hose, they are not sexy to me, or when the are animal hairs in or on the hose)

\-I had sex with a lot of vacuum hoses by cutting the nozzle off and exposing the inside and sticking my thing in (without the power on even), and yes they were not always clean and washed so imagine the hygiene

\-Almost thinking about sex intensely the whole day long and I was fapping so much that I felt the effect everytime, thus saw no gain in being so tired after ejaculating and its just not fun. 

I also did sex without ejaculating when I was in to spirituality (learned my lessons dont like the lifestyle)

\-Searching like a beast all the time for vacuuming women who make sexual videos on the internet and obsessing on that .

\-Once I had to borrow the vacuum cleaner of the neighbour lady here to clean the couch and I ejaculated premature because I got so horny from her vacuum cleaner ( I found her attractive also)

\-Emotionally draining because I feel like I am letting myself down.

After a big porn addiction that I managed to overcome in my teens, I just sat down with myself and really really thought about this fetish. 

I questioned if I genuinly enjoyed all this, but could feel it in my whole body just being a big no when I think rationally.

I dont want to be in to female feet and high heels arent so appealing to me when I am non-horny, I rather write poetry instead.

\-And more

&amp;#x200B;

I really noticed that I am more stubborn in what I want than other people, I really dislike how my sexuality is formed now,

But it now is the only form of sexuality I know and I just crave to finally be able to let this all rest and experiment with

a nice female who understands how hard I have been fighting through this combined with autism my whole life.

I am now sexually inactive but my libido is very high especially bc I am on a carnivore diet..

&amp;#x200B;

About 9 months ago was my senior prom. I'm 100% convinced that night will be the best night of my life for the rest of my life. I know for a fact that I will never ever ever feel that level of happiness ever again. 

Before I went into the prom room with my friends, I took 100mg of molly. I had done molly twice before but neither were in a party setting and therefore neither gave me the happiness that it did on prom night. After prom was over, my friends and I went to our hotel room and all of them went to sleep, except for me who decided to take a relatively small dose of lsd. I spent the rest of the night looking out the window and during this time reached a state of euphoria so intense that I cried twice. 

The timelines a little messy since I didnt sleep that night so I'll explain. Prom was saturday night, I got home sunday afternoon and slept the rest of the day, then returned to school on monday. On Monday I felt pretty depressed and all I could think about was: holy shit I'm never going to feel anything remotely like that ever again.

That same thought has haunted my brain for the past 9 months and I still havent been able to overcome it. I tried recreating the feeling multiple times with multiple different drugs, but I never got there. I'm now 5 weeks clean from hard drugs but I'm still struggling to accept that what I was feeling was an artificial feeling, and that I'm never going to feel it again. Everytime I think about that night I get depressed. I know I'll never be that happy again but at the same time my brain thinks there is going to be another occasion where I successfully recreate that night.

If theres anyone who has or is struggling with a similar situation, do you have any advice?"

    I have been thinking a lot lately about how my legal Rx for 30mg Oxycodone led to the total and complete devastation of my life and soul for a good portion of my young life. 
    Are there any class action suits that are legit and worth joining out there? 
    The companies that knowingly flooded the country with this absolute poison should be held accountable in some way for this.
    I AM aware that I also played a role in all of it myself - however I did not know that using their products would give me a seemingly incurable mental disorder that would lead to financial and emotional ruin to say the very least.
    My Google search has led to confusing results. I was hoping someone out there knows if there's a route to go with this.

addiction,holdthebabyy,2020/2/20,"I think I'm addicted to dating apps Sorry if this isn't the appropriate subreddit but I wanted to talk about this somewhere.

I can't get enough of dating apps, the buzz of checking for new messages and matches has me checking my phone constantly

Yesterday I spend almost all day glued to my phone, swiping right indiscriminately, juggling different conversations, checking my matches.

The funny thing is, once I've 'achieved my goal' of affirming this girl thinks I'm attractive or funny, and I can sense they're interested in talking to me, I lost interest and move onto the next one, a new challenge. One girl started sending me WILD photos of herself but I just ignore her now, she was too easy.

If I fail to achieve this goal then my entire mood can shift and can feel really low about it.

In general, using these apps give me a very fake sense of confidence, fake because it's all just online.

I'm not sure if this is an addiction or something like a personal insecurity or desire for attention. either way, it doesn't feel healthy"
addiction,kazamakarate,2020/1/15,"Addicted to hookers Intro: I like to think I live a disciplined lifestyle. I have a good sleeping and eating rhythm, harsh training regime, I don't party, drink or do drugs and try to be productive every single day. I contribute to society in all kind of ways and work 48 hours a week as a firefighter in a busy European city. I don't have any social media apps and I think this lifestyle, combined with my introvert nature, rarely brings me into contact with girls.

Since a year I also quit watching porn. The first few weeks had their difficult times but it was doable. However, after a few months the urge and need for a sexual partner became unbearable to the point of thinking about sex all day, every day, which messed up my productivity. 

Telling myself I can't relapse no matter what, I started looking up online hookers. It helped, ever since then I haven't thought about watching porn again. Except that looking up prostitutes now feels like a worse addiction, it feels just as wrong as watching porn for similar reasons, except it also costs money. I don't want to watch porn and I don't want to visit hookers. I need help."

I went thru a month of full on residential rehab but when I discharged I only had one option for accommodation and that's with my mother and her alcoholic boyfriend. Went smoothly for a while (well as smooth as having to isolate myself from everyone I knew because of there own addictions and also being hyper paranoid because of past debts still unpaid) then about 2 weeks ago little cracks started to appear. Mum's boyfriend won a hearty amount of money on the pokies machines and decided to leave us (forgot to mention my mum has a snapped ankle so she can't work and hoddles around on crutches) in a house we can't afford without a cent without telling us where he was untill he was in a different state (I'm currently in Victoria he ran away to Queensland). Within 4 days I managed to quit the job I had, spent my first pay from that job (a little over $1000) in a matter of hours on methamphetamine, managed to hide that from mum untill my Centrelink pay came in and that too was spent in 2 maybe 3 hours. Now I'll give myself credit my main poison was heroin and I didn't choose that this time. But still I feel a bit disappointed all that time I had up with it out of my system and I manage to shoot atleaat 3and a half grams up my arm before I knew it was happening.

So I have been addicted to internet porn since I was 12 and I am in my 20s now. I go a week maybe without porn and go back, my recent relapse was 13 days, I have been actively trying to quit over the past 3/4 years but took it more seriously last and this year.

I want to quit porn because I believe that it can have physical harms, such as to my brain, as well as causing depression, and suicide feelings. I have poor mental health, and have had it for over the past several years.

Anyways, I try to quit porn but its difficult because I don't naturally socialize often, I have been single my entire life and don't see myself dating anyone any time soon, so I go back to porn because video games and music can only do so much.

I'm trying to quit to be a decent person and happier I guess.

I realize my singleness is my issue, not the porn, but I'm trying to make my life better, I dislike it currently.

sorry just wanted to say all that. hopefully I can get another streak going and be clean by the end of the year."

I take a maximum of 3mg per 24 hours, which if I'm correct is equal to about 1.5mg of Xanax. I can get by with as little as just 1mg at bedtime, but I need something to help me sleep.

I've had an unhealthy relationship with drink and various drugs throughout my life. In the last 4 years, cocaine and booze have been my vice. 

I've tried to quit plenty, only to relapse. My Dad, during his recovery from his alcohol addiction said to me this, ""there's no such thing as someone who used to be an alcoholic, there's only sober alcoholics"". So I guess for people like me, who are addicts, the battle is never over, you can never stop trying to be sober, and the second you thinn you're over it, is the most dangerous moment that will probably ensue a relapse.

I don't want to keep relapsing, because one day I know it will kill me, I'll die of a heart attack in a cocaine and alcohol fuelled night of chaos. Because of my addiction, I have ended up getting myself into a situation once that saw me end up in intensive care for a month, a wheelchair for two months, and I still have a long road of physio ahead of me.

I've written this post, externalizing my best intentions. Wish me luck.

I'm sorry if this is a long post but as a 27 year old male I have found reddit to be a sanctuary for me since I was 19. Reddit was that person whom I adored but could never muster up the courage to approach. I lurked, I even flirted with the idea of posting on some sports subreddits. But those were the good days in my relationship with reddit. Today as someone who has never reached out for help I am truly desperate. My heart is broken, my soul is tortured and my future is in jeopardy. Dear reddit community, please help me. I come from an impoverished family who risked it all to make it to this country which makes this even more painful for me. If I was an addict in the nation by parents were born in, I'd be dead. However, as a first generation college student in my family I made it from the depths of poverty to graduating from UC Berkeley in Political Science. I'm no better or worse but I sacrificed everything, this country gave me an opportunity to prove my will and my desire through education. I was given a battlefield where all other factors were meaningless, merit was key. 

Today, as I lay in bed 13 days sober and completely dead inside and out, the pain of everything I built being destroyed before my very eyes is otherworldly. In the span of 2 years I went from having foot surgery to being a full blown addict in Los Angeles with nothing left. I first took an opiate when I returned home from college and although I no longer had access to them after my post surgery cycle, I was able to obtain adderall and the rest feels like a flash. When I stopped 13 days ago I had been taking adderall for almost 2 years intermittently and looking for anything I could get my hands on to sleep. This can't be real, all I ever wanted was to teach History and give back to the country that saved my life. To the next generation of youth that without the opportunity I was given, would be relegated to the doldrums of history. Believe it or not, I loved education so much that I'm mourning that loss more than the damage I've inflicted on my family, on my body an on my soul. My thoughts are scattered, my pain is deserved but I just want help. I didn't sleep for 6 days when i stopped, the stress on my family caused my 65 year old mother to get into an accident. I had never seen my father cry before. I saw that too. I don't know if I deserve life any longer for what I've done but if reddit can be the one thing I gain instead of lose from this nightmare, I'd be forever grateful. If there is any help out there for trash like me, I can only promise that if I make it out of this grave I'll spend the rest of my days paying it forward."
addiction,mybpdisvegan,2020/3/5,"If nicotine is one of the world's most addictive substances.... Then how come the few times I've tried vaping (with high amounts of nicotine in the juice) I didn't ever crave the feeling again?

I honestly hate how nicotine makes me feel. Nauseated, dizzy/lihhtheaded, and unfocused. It practically feels like the same feeling I get whenever my iron or blood sugar is too low. Idk how anyone could crave that or get addicted to that feeling. Some people say cigarettes/using nicotine is relaxing or calming but I've always found the opposite to be true when i tried it. It didn't make me feel any different emotionally other than ""Why did I just do that to my lungs?"". 

I have always had it in my head that I have an extremely high potential for addiction especially since practically everyone who is related to me by blood, and most of the people I grew up around were an addict at some point or are currently an addict to something. The person who fathered me was an addict to multiple drugs including cocaine and meth, and my mom used to dabble with drugs a but when she was younger (LSD, pills to my knowledge) and she drank. She still smokes cigs and now has prescription medication but I don't think she's addicted to any of them (I hope not)

I used to be addicted to internet gaming and painting my nails (seriously it was like 4x a day for months, my mom had to tell me to stop) and I've struggled with pornography addiction since around age 9. It is a very real addiction. I don't like watching it or how it makes me feel emotionally or physically yet I can't stop ""using"" and it's ruining my life and self esteem. I am considered an addict to a non-substance tyoe drug. 


TLDR:

Nicotine is said to be more physically addictive and have a higher risk of addiction than some other illegal drugs. I've tried nicotine multiple times and I never once have craved it since trying it. How is it possible that I didn't get addicted to one of the world's most addictive substances after trying it multiple times and despite already brig considered an addict/have a high potential for addiction? I understand not liking the feeling may play a role but is it possible I have a lower risk for addiction than what I've been taught and told my entire life?"

After he came out he began snorting something over the trash can and he laid down in the middle of the store. I told my coworker to get a security guard to help escort him out of the store.

I'm making this post because after a bit of reflection I felt like I could have had more empathy for the man, because addiction is a disease and I don't know what kind of circumstances he's in.I also realized that I should be more aware of the signs of opioid overdose because the man could have very well overdosed in our bathroom when I didn't check on him for over an hour. 

What should I have done in this situation? After what period of time should i have checked on him to make sure wasn't overdosed in the bathroom?

Now, the first thing I want to mention is that I have two ways of looking at this.

One cousin in particular who is my age (25) is very important to me. We grew up together, went to the same school and been very close all through childhood and teenage years. However, during 20's we drifted apart due to me moving to another country and studying, and him for most part working and partying. 

In the start, I would think the partying is something he has to go through, I did party in my early ears myself and have tried numerous drugs, but it stayed at that, trying. However for the past year I am really worried about him and his substance abuse. 

Although for the most part I dont know how much he uses as we live in different countries and he is reluctant to share most details with me as he knows I would tell him to slow down and be carefull. He is in raves a lot and told me about the use of MDMA before, he goes to these raves atleast twice a month, and I guess he is not sober in any of them.

My worries started when he came to visit me about a year and a half ago, and was persistent to get cocaine when we were out in the city, and it didnt end there, he ended up using it most nights of his visit or stayed very quite/passive on the night he didnt. On top of this he was smoking weed everyday, as it is easy to get where I live. 

Last year, he told me how he took magic mushrooms and after he has quit smoking (cigarettes) and doesnt feel drawn to cocaine anymore. Instead, I am now hearing stories of him using LSD and mushrooms quite often, he is still a heavy MJ smoker and drink quite a lot. I feel like he just would do anything to just not be sober.  

I am at this point where I graduated and now am looking to start my career, and I feel like we have nothing in common. Most of the conversations he starts are either about raves, psychadelic trips and parties, and I can't really relate. 

The numerous times I have tried to approach him about this substance use, he just dismisses it or gets upset with phrases like: 'its nice you think I am a junkie' or ' whats your problem? I have a job and a place to stay'.. that context. 

I am very worried about his habits, and dont know how to deal with the situation. None of my other family are aware about this. I mean they dont even know he smokes weed( that unaware). I just feel like I need to help him before it gets worst, I feel like I am responsible in the situation because I am aware of it. How can I help someone that doesnt think they have a problem? any advice welcome..

Thanks in advance

I have now been in my room for the past 4 months, lost all of my friends, my car and girlfriend, with no savings. Sitting here thinking where I have went wrong.

I was a poly drug addict abusing alcohol, kratom, xanax, opiates and cocaine, I would usually use a substance for 2-3 days then switch to another so I never really got physically addicted to anything except kratom a few times. I loved the novelty of using different substances. I have been using drugs for about 2 and a half years on and off. I was also addicted to pornography but I have cut that out of my life as well. I had been using pornography daily for about 6 years. I still am struggling to abstain from fast food as it is extremely convenient and tempting.

addiction,i-me-and-myself,2020/2/2,"""Principles Before Personalities. ""  

So I¡¯ve been going to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings for quite some time now with my dad. Neither of us drink and he claims to go because he wants to meet people and reconnect with old friends apparently. I just go just for my personal amusement. It¡¯s fun to watch losers talk about their pathetic lives in front of other losers.

But as you would expect, I¡¯m not vocal at all about this at meetings. I just sit there silently trying to blend in without saying anything aside from the shit that everyone else says when everyone holds hands and are in a circle. It¡¯s a feeling of *epicaricacy* that is hidden from everyone else.

I¡¯ve heard some unique stories from my time there. There was once this man who grew up with his adopted family in Tijuana and then one day a robber came murdered his entire family when he wasn¡¯t home. This guy claimed that the event put him in ¡°so much rage¡± that¡¯s what made him a drinker. When I told The Boy Named Crow about this, he just said ¡°Damn that sucks.¡±. I said I thought that moment was pretty funny because of how cartoonish it was. It¡¯s kinda weird that this one guy was apparently able to murder an entire household when just trying to kill 2 people on your own can be pretty difficult. It just fell into the realm of unreality.

There always seems to be an old woman with brown hair whenever I go there. I don¡¯t know why.

Yesterday me and dad went to this meeting and this guy was telling this very long story and since we just walked in during the middle of it I don¡¯t really know the whole story and he kept going on about rabbis and god or whatever. The room was really dark which made sense since it was at 10 something PM and I just kept staring at the white LED lights hung on the wall behind him as he spoke and the patterns they made or the ceiling fan and the slow movement it made before it made it¡¯s eventual stop. I remember there was this old guy sitting in a chair in a corner of the room on my right saying stuff like ¡°Oh god is this guy still talking?¡± but no one except me seemed to notice him when he said that at all.

When the guy finally stopped talking all of a sudden some guy in the crowd got up with his shitty acoustic guitar and started playing some shitty song and singing. I told dad ¡°This song is shit.¡± and ¡°We should split.¡±. But dad wanted to stay and said no and I can just go to the car and wait for him if I¡¯d like. But I insisted that ¡°We should go.¡± and eventually I decided to walk home by myself and asked for house keys, which he gave to me.

I just walked home alone that night listening to some podcast that doesn¡¯t suck and went to sleep not long after returning home.

I¡¯m worried about him lately as he has been trying to get off drugs and alcohol, and trying to live a bit more of a wholesome lifestyle as he had a bit of a cocaine problem for a few years. He only really does it now when he drinks, which he never wants to when we¡¯re together...but when his friends ask him to hangout, it¡¯s only ever involving drinking and going out. He¡¯s told all his ¡°friends¡± he¡¯s trying to stop but none of them seem to really care. 

He¡¯s usually pretty good and says no, but a few of his friends have started ripping into him saying that he doesn¡¯t have time for them anymore and I think he feels pressured into doing it, because he doesn¡¯t want to loose friends. 

I don¡¯t know how to approach the situation because I love him and want him to hang out with whoever he wants, but I¡¯m also sick of seeing his friends treat him like shit (in my opinion) and not respect him or his want to live a different kind of life..

Thought I would share it with you as I believe writing it was the first step for me to get off opiates. I found writing helped me figure out my story and where I came from. Even more importantly it got me thinking where I was going. Looking back on that time in my life is really interesting now that I¡¯m finally off the junk and taking steps to fix myself from within.

Social Media

Growing up in North America during the 90's and onward was a pretty awesome experience, having the chance to look back and to reflect on my 30+ years living here, I finally realized this. Nintendo and skateboarding filled my time and life was easy. Having divorced parents gave me the chance to let loose as I had two homes and minimal supervision. As the Millennium rolled in and Y2K subsequently not happening, the world was busy changing and evolving, computers were becoming a more prevalent way of life and more people were succumbing to it. 

Walking home I quickly started writing, as I walked through a women¡¯s protest against Trump being dispersed after their rally was finished. Having to walk against the flow of people was daunting, a person not walking in line with the majority. It must have triggered something in me, a desire to create flowed eloquently, like lava from a volcano into my mobile device.

I remember being in the bathroom in elementary when I heard about the twin towers. Everyone was talking about it. Classes stopped and all the teachers and students were all watching the event unfold in front of our eyes. It was an act of horrible human cruelty that I had never seen before being so young and I believe it changed us all in an instant. I also remember people cheering when they caught those responsible, also played out for us on television, I never actually saw them catch him, only what I saw on television to go on. I believed it as my parents did and everyone else did as well, the hive mind alive in us even that young. We were getting used to watching world event's displayed to us on televisions and we accepted this as a convenience to radio and prior technology. It was only a matter of time the majority of the first world would grow to love their screens and use them as tools to gain information and give fake information for years to come.

Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tinder, Snapchat, you name it, they got it. Choose your narcissist drug of choice in this game of information gathering. Hey! I am over here everyone, look at me. This is my butt, these are my boobs, here are those things again from a slightly different angle for the 500th time. This is my car, cat, mat, hat, shat, you get the picture. You name it they got it. I remember deleting Facebook and honestly it was one of the best feelings I have ever had, it was truly a problem for me, checking it constantly and making me think it was important.

I got into heroin a year ago around this time and boy let me tell you, it's been a hell of a year. I OD'd this one night when I was having a fire with the boys at our friends house down by the river, thank god my mate called the ambulance that night. The fentanyl they cut my heroin with made me pass out and stop breathing, the EMT told me later at the hospital, I had been unconscious for at least 15 minutes, any longer and I would have been in a lot more trouble. I remember trying to do a bump of heroin, without any fentanyl cut in it, after a few days of sober recovery from the incident and having a subsequent panic attack. Apparently my body didn't care for the heroin anymore, I had developed a physical reaction to the opiate from overdosing on the fentanyl the week before. I felt mad that this transformation of attitude had taken place and that my body couldn't get high anymore followed quickly by the feeling of shame, how did I turn into this monster so quickly?"

addiction,khlind,2020/3/5,"Concerns Regarding Addiction and My Physical Dependency to Substances and Xanax  Hi all,

New here and looking for some guidance/reassurance. Feel free to skip right now to my question regarding my xanax addiction, or continue below for context about myself: 

I'm a 22 y/o college student w/ ADHD who has had a problem with substances since Jan, 2018 (following a break-up). I am not depressed (I think), but I do have a pretty bad case of social anxiety. For the past two years, I have drank, abused weed, abused Adderall (prescribed &amp; snorted it), been on and off nicotine, dabbled with coke, mixed drugs, glorified drug-use, been 24/7 sleep-deprived, and until recently, started abusing Xanax. I don't think I've been straight up sober for more than two weeks consecutively for the past two years. I have been aware of my substance problem for over a year, and now that it is reaching a breaking point, I realize I HAVE to change (I've been trying on my own for over a year). Combined with my four concussions, my substance abuse, poor health, and bad habits are just about to prove natural selection still exists for an employed (offer is to start this June), financially-dependent, white male. I wholeheartedly believe I am approaching the point of no return; so, I have decided it is time to seek help. 

Let's get to the point:

I have used Xanax around 5-7 days per week ranging from 0.75mg to 4.5mg for about 6 weeks. I use it for just about anything - to party, get a decent sleep, help me speak better in front of my classmates, or just mellow out. 

Here's my main question:

Have I been taking Xanax long and consistently enough that I will experience *physical* withdrawal symptoms if I go cold turkey? I can't seem to pinpoint a timeframe from my research. I'm kinda scared bc. I've read withdrawal symptoms include seizures. If I have been using it long enough, is there an optimized ""homemade"" method to tapering off? Not quite sure what to do here bc. one day I'll take half, the next a quarter, and the next a bar and a half (dosages are pretty random).

Here's my plan (which I would appreciate your thoughts on as well): 

I'm setting up an appointment with a therapist tomorrow through a school program for either Friday or as soon as I get back from spring break, which is March 7-14. I've decided this is the time to detox bc. I'll be visiting my sister in Florida, so I can literally go cold turkey given the environment. The plan is to exercise and meditate every day. Now, when I get back to school, there's a concert on the 14th that I'm definitely drinking w/ friends before... The plan is to keep it to JUST alcohol. I'm sorta viewing it as an incentive to stay sober for spring break. If all goes to plan, I will then remain sober for 30 days and focus on catching up in school. I will also try to use Adderall as it should be used, in a very limited and controlled fashion. However, I want your opinion on how I should move forward with my addy use as well (given my tendency to crave other drugs on it). Even though I have ADHD, I don't know if addy should be in my life, period... I feel like its time to ""outgrow"" my ADHD and train my focus via meditation. 

In conclusion:

That's about all I can share given my exam in 3 hours, which is gonna make or (probably) break my economics minor... What do you think about my concerns surrounding my Xanax use and my planned next steps? Thank you in advance for help - it feels good just to get this off my chest!!"

I find myself making little almost ""goals"" for myself, ""oh ill quit when that happens"" or ""ill try to throw it then"", im really just procrastinating the whole endeavor. So, quite spontaneously, i've decided im going to try.  I started a anti depressant called Wellbutrin, I looked up some of the effects one night and smoking cessation aid came up, so I figured its as good as time as any. I had one last cig and couldn't even finish it without feeling slightly nauseous so it seems to be working. Hopefully that will be the last of my life.  I could use some tricks or tips if you guys have any! I think its just gonna be a brutal week, a test of self control.

addiction,iZaya-11,2020/4/10,"A 17 Year Olds Story of Addiction (Need to get this off my chest)  I'm 17 years old, soon to be 18. Before I got addicted to cocaine and adderall, I was a victim of addiction itself. 

My two brothers were never around growing up, because they were busy popping pills. The pill popping quickly turned into full blown addictions to Meth and Heroin. One brother is now 2 years clean from Heroin, but still slips up on Oxy's here and there. The other is doing time in prison.

  
My father was a cocaine addict and alcoholic, and my mother was addicted to Adderall. My grandfather was an alcoholic, and my uncle was addicted to Xanax and also an alcoholic.  
I was always the good kid growing up. I had great grades, a sweet heart, and a poetic talent and spirit. However, I was never happy. Ever since 12 years old, I'd had suicidal thoughts. Ever since Grade 1, I'd always been bullied by other kids and never accepted in any friend groups.  
I always was intelligent, but hated myself. I never loved myself for who I was because I felt as if nobody else did.

  
 So, at 12 years old I'd smoked weed for the first time and LOVED it. At 13 years old, I became a daily pot smoker and LITERALLY did not stop at all until just 4 days ago at 17. My dad supplied me with weed to, ""stay off of the other drugs,"" but really I ended up just being unhappy with only smoking weed and got into harder stuff.

  
 Freshmen year, age 15, I got expelled from higshchool. I drink half a jar of moonshine not knowing how strong it actually was. I ended up calling the cops on myself thinking it would be funny. After that, I entered a HUGE depression because I had no friends, my family thought I was a loser, and all I had was Mary Jane to get me through those days.  
Throughout the 3 year span from then and now, I'd tried a handful of drugs. Spice, Oxy, LSD, Adderall, Vyvanse, Cocaine, MDMA, DXM, Alcohol, Xanax, came DANGEROUSLY close to trying meth and heroin, and smoked massive amounts of pot. I also got super hooked on first cigarettes, but enjoyed vaping high nicotine e-liquid better.  
But something about the stimulants hooked me. And that happened just at the end of last year.  
I kept on rationalizing to myself that it was just recreational and that I would do it, ""just one more time.""

  
 One more time turned into 8 straight months of hell and addiction to a level I've never before experienced. Doing line after line, popping pill after pill, and watching litterally 100s and 100s of hours of porn while geeked out of my MIND. It is still somewhat triggering to talk about it, because the memories of being high bring back such STRONG feelings within me.   
But I am now 10 days clean of any adderall or cocaine. I am 4 days clean of marijuana. And tommorow, I know it's finally time for me to put down nicotine and, the least harmful (but still harmful) drug of my choice, caffeine.  
I make rap music, play guitar, write poems and songs, listen to music, and spend time with my recovering brother (who gives me such great motivation to stay clean). This helps me stay sober.  
But there's definitely times throughout the day where I don't feel like doing anything but laying in bed wallowing in my sorrow.  
I know this withdrawal is not permanent, but I also know that I will always have the addict inside me, and that recovery is a LIFELONG proccess.   
Thank you so much for listening to my story, it means the world to me:)"

addiction,Random13509,2020/4/13,"Regrets and resentments I was reading here the other day, and if I remember correctly, I read a post each on regrets and resentments. I am at a place where I want to turn certain aspects of my life around. I'm not ""in the gutter"" so to speak, I have been a somewhat functional addict, though if I am honest with myself, I have not lived up to my potential. There is also a pretty dark secret side to my life that others just don't see or know the depths of. I know I have personal demons I have tried to numb and escape from. And in the numbing and escaping, I have created more personal demons. It is a bad cycle that I want to get out of. I am too old for this, and I feel like I am getting at an age where there is a bit of a crossroads, and I need to decide where I am going to head from here. I am further along this life's path than I'd like to admit, and ignoring life like I have in many ways so far starts to look a little grim.

In regards to the regrets, I can get pretty bummed out over all the doors that have closed in my life over time, whether because of any direct action on my part, or even more so inaction. I was helpless with my stuff for so long, in many ways I just skated through life, not actively engaging being the person I would have wanted to be. There is some background trauma that I feel drove a lot of this. I know I have to do a lot of work on acceptance, I need to make good choices, and I need to start focusing more on the doors that are open for me in the present. They are there, but I will not lie, I get really stuck on what I missed out on. This is a big one for me.

In regards to resentments, and what brought me to post this, I just got very triggered thinking about family resentments. I have gained a lot of clarity in my life as to how everything unfolded, why things were the way they were. There is some anger there. Again, I need to work on acceptance, and I need to get more in the present, making my life more worthy of one worth living going forward.

I am not sure what else to add, I just wanted to get this off my chest. I want to think a little more about how regrets and resentments play into my addictive behaviors. I see how easy I can spiral down these emotional holes, and then I want to get away from that place they put me in. I hopefully am learning, and hopefully I will keep doing the work to do better. Thanks."
addiction,mayonnaise123,2020/4/4,"My best friend has been missing for almost a week My best friend, a prior heavy opioid user who I believe relapsed, has been missing for 5 days. Life is too much.

When I was a senior in high school I got into weed and over the years it escalated until 21/22. I met a friend and eventually roommate trying to sell him mushrooms lol but I helped him get off heroin and live with me because he was basically living in a trap house before. Given his history or serious drug use I¡¯m horrified that he is dead in a ditch with a needle in his arm because no one can reach him and we¡¯ve searched all around his neighborhood and called his friends, coroners office, hospitals, and jails and nothing. I¡¯ve lost 4 people to drugs and suicide since 2018, one on my couch. I found him dead in the morning from mixing fentanyl, oxy, Xanax, and rum. I¡¯ve also witnessed a death involving severe trauma where he fell off a ramp and split his skull on the concrete and I was the only one with him while he died. It was also partially my fault, he was homeless and asked me to buy him cigarettes so I did and I gave him some free benzodiazepines when he was clearly drunk and he fell backwards over a guardrail on a ramp directly on his skull. I¡¯ve lost others to suicide or overdose but I wasn¡¯t there for those. 

Also, my brother is in serious danger with covid 19. He has mitochondrial disease and for someone with his diseases he is fairly healthy and normal and a 19 year old college freshman. Unfortunately mitochondrial disease affects muscle strength so while he can breathe just fine, he needs more time for altitude adjustments and he also gets dehydrated very easily which is why he has a feeding tube but that¡¯s only a partial fix. His specialist said that if he gets sick there¡¯s a 70% chance of him being admitted to the ICU on a ventilator and that¡¯s horrifying because we don¡¯t have enough and if they have to ration them to the people most likely to live, he will die.

I¡¯ve overdosed, had my dad get violent with me and drive drunk with me, I handled my parents divorce alright and I¡¯ve made it through watching my brother starve to death when I was 6-8  before we could figure out what was wrong and what to do. So my entire life I¡¯ve been in crisis mode and I can¡¯t take it anymore, I can¡¯t take all of the death.?"
addiction,splattycatty,2020/1/17,"So tired of my nephews bullshit. I myself am an alcoholic in recovery, 41 Y/O working full time while living with, and caring for, my elderly parents aged 81&amp;73. The duty has fallen on me due to my siblings all having their own families while I am childless by choice. I don't mind, I have my own life outside of working and caregiving. My folks are still pretty independent but sorely need the financial and household help I bring to the table by living with them.

The problem is my nephew (23Y/O) He is an addict who has been in and out of rehabs and mental hospitals more times than I can count. He never makes it more than 8 hours after a discharge before getting high. Torching every bridge he crosses my parents are the only stable thing he has. He lives here and does nothing but cause trouble for us. His DOC is meth, without meth he will do anything he can to get fucked up, herion, pills, booze... He has drank rubbing alcohol, flavor extracts, mouthwash, in a real pinch with no fix he will go outside and huff gasoline in the garage. 

He smokes in the house with no regard for my mothers emphysema, he has stolen 1000s of dollars of money/valuables from all of us, guns, electronics, cash, anything of value ... He brings lowlife bums into the house without asking. I am fucking sick of his addictions ruining what should be my parents golden years.

I want to leave this place for my own sanity and sobriety, but without my contribution my parents will lose the house they love so much. I want to force an ultimatum of 'him or me' on them, but I refuse to further break their already torn hearts. I want my nephew to WANT to get the help he so desperately needs before it's to late, but I don't think that will happen so I want him to end up in prison rather than end up dead in a ditch because those are the only options he is giving himself.

I needed to get that off my chest for my own sake. He was discharged 2 weeks into a 90 day recommendation yesterday... My spare PC Monitor is now missing along with him while I was at work today. I was feeling a strong urge to drink because I was very angry but that feeling has subsided. Now I just feel pity for him.

addiction,laciedawn,2020/4/8,"advice on quitting adderall.. with a long back story for context lol Okay so I got prescribed adderall when I was a little girl took it up until middle school then stopped taking it because I had the memory of a gold fish and it was a low dosage so I wasn't completely dependent on it. In the time I didn't take it I was a full time competitive cheerleader practicing 5 days a week hours on end training and conditioning. I had well enough energy for me and never thought about the drug. 

While in high school I heard one of my friends talking about how they got prescribed and it was the best thing ever and I remember asking myself ""I wonder why I stopped taking my prescription?"" . Probably not long after that I started my prescription back up at a 20mg dosage and felt like a whole new productive me. I lost weight and felt like I was on top of the world but never really correlated the adderall and my productiveness, I was a dumb high schooler I know. But after my body started getting used to my 20 mg dosage I soon realized I hadn't been doing the same in sports or school and decided maybe I need to up my dosage so now I have been taking a 30 mg dosage ever since.

I am 20 years old will be 21 in September (:

I am wanting to enlist into the military and have to stop taking it...

To be quite frank I'm scared shitless, because after switching to the 30 mg dosage I started to depend on adderall more and more. Say I accidentally forgot to take it one day or my pharmacy didn't fill my prescription in time I will break down in a anxiety attack because the effects of not taking it after taking it for so long are ruthless and just didn't want to have to go through it. The complete lack of energy I have and the appetite of 4 grown men really do a toll on me. I never really thought anything of it and didn't take it seriously, I just thought that it was me being lazy.

I don't know the clear defining of being addicted or being dependent on the drug I just know when I wake up I just have a routine of waking up taking my adderall having a coffee and some breakfast then after it would start to kick in I would proceed to do what I had to do that day.

I have tried not to take it weeks at a time, not stopping all together, every once and awhile because I didn't think the adderall was the thing making me, me. I would eventually gain weight from the constant eating, and then proceed to sleep and sleep and sleep. Eventually ending up taking it again thinking I didn't take it for a week and didn't like the person I was and just thought that was my personality.

SOOOO with all that said I don't even know where to start. I don't think slowly reducing my dosage will work, I feel FOR ME, I just have to stop taking it all together. I'm hoping there are people who have gone through similar situation or just even quitting the drug like I am attempting to do.

Tomorrow I am not going to take my adderall and need advice on what to do to help the crash of the drug. I am desperate for any tips because I am so scared of the physical and mental exhaustion from stopping.

addiction,Dave234567,2020/2/20,"Anyone experience withdrawals from stopping heavy daily weed use? I had a surprise when I tried to stop everything for a week. Day 3 I was lethargic, had trouble focusing and blurry vision, head ¡°chills¡± going down into my spine, even more shaky than usual with muscle twitches, and I was hotter than usual, tingling/numbness on finger tips and lips at one point. Then day 4 was the opposite, had more than enough energy even without caffeine, but crazy anxiety and jitters that got worse throughout the day until eventually it turned to a steady panic attack for hours until me and my girlfriend started getting into an argument and I said fuck it. 

Growing up it was always said pot doesn¡¯t give you withdrawals, so I¡¯m skeptical. Maybe its somehow in my head and you guys telling me that will help next time. But at one point it was close to when I came off benzos suddenly, but  without the head zaps. 

I have smoked/vaped heavily without fully missing a day for at least 2 years. Whenever I¡¯m not working basically. I relied on it with my depression, to unwind after a stressful day, and to eat since at one point I stopped eating and I haven¡¯t gotten any hunger back even though I¡¯m in a better place.

addiction,Aand732,2020/1/9,"Advice on Helping Cocaine/ Alcohol Addict My best friend of a decade relapsed after being off cocaine for months. I am trying to help them get clean, and healthy without enabling them but I am having a hard time figuring out where to draw the line. 

Little bit of background: I have known them since we were kids. They have always struggled with extreme anxiety and chronic depression. Their substance abuse issues have developed as unhealthy coping mechanisms. I have tried to encourage them to seek treatment but they have been unwilling until now to do anything but self medicate. They know they are an alcoholic but have continued to drink. They constantly have smoked weed since college. That progressed to cocaine abuse. 

They finally saw the damage that cocaine had done to themselves and their relationships (including our friendship) and managed to make it nearly a year without using again. However, they continued to smoke and drink. I hoped it would last but everything I read said that most addicts need to quit all substances or risk relapse. 

I wasn't able to visit or see them for a few months. I was struggling too and we fell out of contact for a while. I talked to them right after Christmas and they said they were really depressed again. Their anxiety had flared up too and they weren't able to do everyday tasks. They sounded serious when they said that they needed and wanted professional help. I agreed to come help them sort out some of the everyday stuff (cleaning, shopping, etc.) and help them find a therapist. They admitted that they probably would have killed themselves if I hadn't. 

I suspected that they were using again. When I saw them, they were so underweight that it looked like they had starved. They barely eat, or sleep. 

Present Day: They admitted they are using again. They said they want to stop but are afraid that they won't be able to keep their life together if they do. I hate the idea of  them continuing to use. I don't want to be around it. They also admitted that they live with people who also use. 

I don't want to make them feel bad about struggling or feel like they can't confide in people.  I think if I tried to get them to stop right now that they will clam up and won't get any help at all. It seems like they are wavering between wanting help and being able to still use. I also realize that they may have to solve one problem at a time and seeking help for their mental health issues may help them recover from substance abuse. 

How should I handle this? What boundaries can I put in place to make sure they aren't taking advantage of me and that I am not enabling them while still helping my friend? I want to help them feel less anxious by taking care of the everyday stuff so they can focus on finding the energy for therapy but I am afraid that if things get better they will dismiss how serious their mental health and addiction issues are."

I've thought a lot these past few days, but mostly been insanely surprised at how mild the withdrawal symptoms are, when I've gone through withdrawals plenty of times, from less than what I've been taking and being fine with for months now. I've decided there are more than likely a couple of reasons for that. Reason 1) this is the first time I've truly decided on my own that it was time to do this instead of having the loss of my children as the main driving factor, unfortunately, that was enough to get me clean, not enough to keep me clean (I honestly can't say I'll stay clean this time, I'm just saying the withdrawal is different) 2) Its also the first time I've decided to get clean that I'm not sitting in a government housing apartment surrounded by all of my drug addicted friends doing and/or selling my DOC and I'm actually at a pretty good place mentally and physically.

I do think having a pretty long moment of not having to worry about work helps too, I just thought it was a really good time. I'm not saying it's been a walk in the park and I feel great three days in, I'm just saying it's better than past withdrawals have been for me.

I'm not saying anyone else should try to take this time of being told to stay at home to do the same, but I do think that a lot of us are tired, a lot of us are still dying and it's not due to the corona virus, a lot of us are still putting ourselves at risk so we can get our meds or get our fix, and maybe some of us can take this moment to try to take our lives back from the still very real opiate epidemic. Maybe we could stop watching so many of our far too young friends die.

I also do not want to go to rehab because I would rather not have people know. I was hoping I could receive some advice on the best way to quit (cold turkey, wending off ect)  and copping mechanisms. If anyone could please give me advice it would be greatly appreciated."
addiction,SubjectEscape,2020/2/5,"Update: 5 months sober, still feel like shit. I wrote a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/d1khg6/getting_sober_starting_tomorrow_how_long_until_i/) about 5 months ago right before I got sober from a slew of drugs, and I wanted to post a brief update here. My main motivation for getting sober was because I wanted to try an MAOI for my depression, and unfortunately it didn't help, so I've been taken off of it. As soon as my psychiatrist made that call, I heard a voice in the back of my head tell me, ""This means you can start using drugs again."" 

I don't know if I want to stay sober. I didn't feel any better, and my brain is so fucked up from all the substance use that I still feel like I'm living in a dissociated fog. My depression is worse than ever, so I wonder: was it worth it? At least when I did drugs I would listen to music, journal, and enjoy myself. Now I just feel completely dead inside and have no motivation or attention span. I'd get it if I were 30 days in and feeling this way, but at 5 months in, I gotta say I'm disappointed that I never got that ""cloud nine"" feeling of clarity. 

So yeah. I successfully stayed off hard drugs for 5 months without going inpatient or getting help for substance abuse, but I'm tempted to start using again in a week when the MAOI is fully out of my system and it's physically safe to use again. I know I'm rationalizing a bad decision. I just want to feel better, even if only for a little while."
addiction,TigerTamer23,2020/4/14,"What are some of the dangers of caffeine addiction? I am not sure if I am a caffeine addict, but I will say I drink an absurd amount of black coffee (and sometimes tea). I consistently drink it throughout the day and very frequently have at least one cup before going to bed. I find that it relaxes me. I usually don't get the jittery feeling a lot of people will talk about when drinking coffee either, but whenever I do I love it. If I ever have to go a day without the drink, it doesn't seem to be an issue. But with that said, that is a rare occurrence and I have not really tried to avoid it for a long period (minus a period of about 2-3 weeks when I only drank tea instead). I was just wondering if it sounds like I have a caffeine addiction to you guys and what some of the dangers of that would be?"

addiction,tiffybiffy,2020/1/4,"A conversation of our opinion on addiction between my coworker and I~ This is gonna sound a bit odd because I just copied and pasted it from my blog. Ignore it if you can. Smite me in your comment(s) if you want. 

Today, I had a bouncy conversation with a coworker I¡¯ll call J. I use the adjective bouncy because we seemed to have spoken about 4 different topics in under 15 minutes. I like those types of conversations because it shows how much you can stretch into a single talk. For instance, the title of this post was one of the many topics we discussed while we vegged out at the front desk. I can¡¯t be 100% on what steered the talk of drug and alcohol addiction. Regardless, he asked my opinion of it and I have to admit that I prefer asking other people about their thoughts rather than think it through, myself. I have a generic idea of what I think of addiction: it¡¯s bad. 
So, I asked J what he thought of the subject and these were his words (paraphrased because we all know I don¡¯t remember much), ¡°Ultimately, they bring it upon themselves.¡± J and I spoke of some personal examples (he used to be a cop so he saw some shit) and he explained that he didn¡¯t feel for people who spiraled into addicted because they should, at some point, find their limits. 
For the most part, I agree with him. Of course, there are days when someone may want to drink or even go as far as getting shit-faced, but you have to remind yourself of your responsibilities. The thing is, no one has the same situation and I really don¡¯t enjoy generalizing the universe. 
The other side to this is people who either don¡¯t become addicts or people who choose to seek help understand that drugs and alcohol outside of moderation are not good for you. Therefore, they should not make the mistake/keep making the mistake. That¡¯s what confuses me. If there are people out there who understand then what¡¯s to say about the others who don¡¯t? Or maybe they do understand but choose not to change; therefore they are bringing it upon themselves, as J said. 
When I told him about wanting to turn our conversation into a blog post, he assumed you readers would scramble to your keyboards to disagree with him, but I can¡¯t say I can agree with him. First of all, I don¡¯t get comments. Second, I don¡¯t know if there are too many people who disagree on his standpoint. 
I know some people may say, ¡°Oh but addiction is derived from trauma and some people simply can¡¯t stop using and don¡¯t have the money for help.¡± However, that brings us back to the initial question of, ¡°If people understand addiction is bad, why would they fall into it to begin with?¡± There¡¯s plenty to dissect with this topic and I¡¯m interested in hearing any other standpoints to this. Like I said before, I don¡¯t like generalizing everyone¡¯s situation so I can¡¯t completely agree with J. However, you have to admit he does make a good point."
addiction,AnnaE390,2020/1/7,"I¡¯ve recently discovered my sister is addicted to crack, and she is having paranoid thoughts. My sister attempted suicide two months ago.  That¡¯s when I discovered that she was addicted to cocaine.

She was held overnight at the hospital and for a couple of days until some hack psychologist signed her out, believing she was unlikely to do it again.

She was back in the hospital a couple days later from another suicide attempt.


She¡¯s back home now, but now she¡¯s expressing paranoid thoughts.  This morning, she texted me believing that someone entered our home and returned a DVD to her bedroom without anyone knowing.  She is CONVINCED.  She also believes that pamphlets with rehabilitation services are purposely placed in her line of sight whenever she recovers from a night of  getting high or dreams about getting high.

I am at a complete loss.

I don¡¯t know what to do or how to convince her to go to rehab/see a therapist.

I¡¯ve been speaking with her all morning, but she¡¯s convinced she just needs to be alone to get better.  Although she admits she only gets high when she is stressed and depressed (which is why she believes she¡¯d be better off alone with no distractions to make her stressed and depressed), which is obviously nonsense.  

She also believes that her paranoid thoughts are an attempt by ¡°us¡± to make her look insane so we can commit her to a ¡°nut house.¡±

I want to help her as best I can.  I want her to get help immediately, and I¡¯m willing to do anything to make that happen.  But I also feel like time is ticking.  I also discovered she¡¯s prostituting to support her habit, and the next step is stealing to get high, including from me.

addiction,Rockima,2020/1/7,"What do you think of group therapy? So clean for 2 weeks and my casemanager thought group therapy would be a great follow up after my detox.

To be honest, I hate it. I don't care about other peoples(strangers) problems and with every subject I have to wait for each individual to respond. It feels like everything they try to learn me, could easily fit in one hour if I would be alone. I notice some in the group really like to talk 'bout themselves while I try to keep my answer short so that others also have a chance to speak. I zone out a lot, can't sit still and notice I'm really inpatient. I feel no connection with the group because they come from different enviourments and most are alcoholics, what had never been a problem for me. I understand a group like this can support me, but I already have a lot of support from my parents and friends. I'm not in the mood to hear extra drama and feels like it's bringing me down.

I have dialed back my porn consumption a TON but last night I was consoling a friend who found out they lost someone while we were hanging out together and the stress of consoling my crying friend made me extremely stressed. After they left, my mind went on auto-pilot and went to the Instagram of a girl I like, and I opened a webcam site after that, and, well. 

In addition, I had a sex dream last night, and since I used to be such a stoner, remembering my dreams period wasn¡¯t happening. It was detailed, nice dream where I had a loving partner. Then I woke up and felt utter horror. 

I know what will be said - delete instagram. I am one of those people that genuinely uses it for work and cannot so easily divorce myself from it.

addiction,seethroughtop,2020/2/2,"Have I ruined my life? I went to a 'networking event' the other night, only had 4 glasses of wine but I'm pretty small and a lightweight (25/F). Headed home with a friend - we live in college campus accommodation.

He made it back to his room but I was stopped on the way in and deemed 'incredibly intoxicated'. I had honestly been fine up until that point but I guess it all hit me pretty hard on the way home. 

Campus security basically decided I needed to go to hospital to be checked out, but I insisted I was fine and just wanted to head to my room. They eventually relented and escorted me to my room, but not without telling my roommate about the incident and instructing her to take care of me. (For context, it's a building housing only grad students and professors, so drinking is not forbidden).

Obviously my roommate was furious and kept asking me what drugs I had taken, not believing me when I told her I hadn't. Once I thought she had gone to bed, I decided to avoid the tension by heading to a friend's room on a different floor (he invited me over). Unfortunately he had changed room recently, so a Resident Assistant then found me on a different floor waiting for him to text me back, she definitely did not believe me that I was meeting someone so brought me back to my floor. FINALLY got in touch with my friend, went to his and vented/recovered from the incident.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day I got an email from the Residential Services with an 'account' of the night before and checking that I was okay. I responded but they are out of office for the weekend. I also emailed the Resident Assistant in question and she was super nice about everything.

&amp;#x200B;

ANYWAY I'm completely freaking out. The past two days I haven't left my room because I'm too scared to face my roommate, let alone the building security guys on front desk. I'm literally petrified but this can't go on forever. I can't believe this all escalated so fast over a few glasses of wine. 

WTF do I do? Will I face major repercussions for this?

addiction,LookingforQandA,2020/4/14,"Recent Cocaine Relapse: 3 Questions (Long post imo) Some background, I recently completed a 3 1/2 Month 12 Step Treatment program in late 2019 and have since relapsed just after getting my 8 months clean, then a month went by and I just finished my worse bender ever. I currently live with the person I relapsed with (he was clean for 9 or 10 months as well). Sorry in advance for the grammar..

Question 1:

What alternatives are out there for Programs besides the 12 Steps?

I had a some good progress with some of the Steps, Steps 4 and 5 were eye opening, and Step 10 has been helpful but overall I couldn't  get behind believing in the spirituality aspect of the throughout the 12 steps. Hell I got into arguments in group several times and almost left a couple times as I felt the spirituality part was being shoved down my throat as an aesthetic plus I'm stubborn as a mule. I'm thinking I need to start attending meetings again, find activities to keep my busy, and communicate with people  who care are in my life. I'm not sure if I do another 3 to 4 month program again at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

Question 2:

Should I move out? I'm on the fence about it.  I think I just need to have a good heart to heart with him about everything before giving up on our friendship.

Question 3:

Should I tell my parents? 

They are a huge part of my life, and I discovered through therapy (before going to Treatment) that when they moved away to retire that it was one of my many triggers that started my addiction with drugs. They were heart broken when I first told them I had problem before going to rehab but they have been as supportive as they from across the country. The main reason I don't want to tell them is because they already worry about me 24/7, think I'm going die everyday even before I relapsed, they have no trust in me. As I'm typing out my reasoning, I think their just excuses and I'm more afraid than anything of losing them.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for suggestions and to hear from people about experiences with their relapses and what they did to recover. 

Before I started writing this post I had a bunch of questions, which I now can't think of. Hell I even feel better after writing all this out to be honest. Thanks in advance!"

This person is someone who I have known my entire life and has never even smoked pot. In fact, they have been adamant their entire life that they would never do or try any illegal drug. They have never shown any signs of taking any drugs before and I fully believe that they wouldn't even know how to get their hands on it, if they wanted it.
This person has been quarantined and not left their house in over a month because of Covid-19. No one has entered the house and they have not left.
On Wednesday, this person was found by the neighbor, outside and disoriented. They were taken to the hospital, had a seizure on the way, and has followed the symptoms of a PCP overdose to a ""T"". 
Are their ways that someone could unknowingly take the drug? 
How likely is it that it could have been in something they ate or drank and didn't know about it? 
Are their any other medications that can present in the same way if overdosed? 
Will this person be the same person I have known my whole life when they come out of the overdose?

The problem is, I believe it¡¯s making my mental state even worse. For the past 4 months I¡¯ve suspected that my marijuana usage has been intensifying my anxiety and depression, as well as making me lethargic, lazy, and generally unwell. My grades have dropped, I¡¯m completely broke, I¡¯ve been constantly asking my closest friends for loans, and I cannot find the drive to get out my bed and do something with my life. The worst part is I¡¯m almost finished with high school  - a time where I¡¯ve got to be at least a little clear headed. 

My usage also causes me lots of guilt, which only further worsens my mental state. It¡¯s killing me, because no matter how guilty I feel, no matter how many times I tell myself to stop smoking, I cannot quit for the life of me. Even when I do make progress, such as learning to only smoke at night, it doesn¡¯t seem to make a difference. 

At the moment, weed is literally the only fucking thing I care about. Nothing else. Its become my hobby and my crutch. It¡¯s the only thing I can talk about, the only thing that will allow me to actually feel happy.

I never used to have an addictive personality, I have tried other drugs (molly, weed, lsd etc) and was able to control any impulse to use keeping it to limited occasions, however with cocaine I always find a way to convince myself to do it, thinking it¡¯ll be different or something.  

I¡¯ve been doing it for about two years now, it started off as a way to self medicate and deal with my depression however Ive realized that it is not the way to deal with this and have accepted that I am addicted. I¡¯ve overdosed, had it ruin my relationships with my mom and boyfriend, dropped out of school, and  pretty much just ruined any motivation I had to do shit with my life. 

I¡¯m on track to getting my life together finally now. I have a new job that pays well, and got accepted to go back to school next semester. I really want to continue on this good path and don¡¯t want to let this addiction ruin my life.

Rehab unfortunately does not work for me. I know that is the preferred method. I am really forced to do this on my own. None of my friends or any one close to me share this issue. 

If any one has any advice on things they or people they know did to quit on their own, any tips and tricks that helped them when they¡¯d feel weak or compelled to use, i would really appreciate it."
addiction,Prize-Raspberry,2020/3/5,"I can¡¯t seem to stop, don¡¯t know what to do. I take oxycodone for severe chronic pain, I¡¯ve had it for 2-3 years and never abused it, partly because I never even felt any ¡°high¡± feelings. Within the last couple months, it¡¯s like something clicked inside me, some button got switched on or something, and I started taking more than my prescribed dose (like one extra pill a day, that¡¯s it) to feel a bit more¡­not high or anything, but more peaceful. It¡¯s barely noticeable since I¡¯m not taking a bunch at one time, but it definitely helps when I¡¯m stressed out or panicking or even when I¡¯m deathly bored. I¡¯m on disability for bipolar disorder and my chronic pain, so I¡¯m stuck inside all day long, and it can get crazy boring. I also have PTSD and the oxy can stave off a panic attack.

My doctor prescribed a slightly higher amount of pills last month - 10 extra a month, so it¡¯s not like I can massively abuse them. I still have more flexibility now though on how and when I take them. It seems like once I took it for emotional/psychological reasons one time, it was easier to do a second time, then a third, then it¡¯s a semi-regular thing.

The last couple weeks I have wanted to try really hard to go back to my normal prescribed dose and dosing schedule. But I can¡¯t seem to stick to it. Every time I take it for non-pain reasons, I tell myself, this is the last time you can do this. But then the next day or day after, I can¡¯t stop myself.

I don¡¯t know what the future holds. Part of me wants to tell my doctor I can¡¯t have them at all, the addiction gene is too strong in my family (killed my grandma actually) I have too many emotional problems to have access to this powerful mood-affecting drug. But then what about my very real pain?

I just don¡¯t know how to stop what I¡¯ve started, don¡¯t know what happens next, and I¡¯m worried about myself. Any advice?"
addiction,chubbybunnybean,2020/3/5,"Requesting advice for a loved one For a little bit of backstory/context. I am married to a wonderful woman, we have been together eight years this spring.

I knew early on that she had recovered from a cocaine addiction. The last time had been several years before we had even met. She went cold turkey and hasn't touched it in about ten years. Other then some shitty (former) friends offering her some early on in our relationship this issue has never really come up.

However, the other day my wife confided in me that she still thinks of it often. She must have seen the look of pure fear on my face because she quickly assured she she'd never, ever, ever ever touch the stuff again.

However I can't stop worrying about this. For example, shortly after this conversation we went to see the movie Birds of Prey. And there is a scene (no spoilers) where Harley Quinn is in the middle of a fight, a bunch of bags of cocaine were shot open, Harley breathes the stuff in, gets a rush of energy and wins the fight.

Two things, it sicked me to my stomach to see this drug portrayed in such a positive light and second, I couldn't help but worry/fear of how this was affecting my wife.

I am asking advice because I really have no idea/experience with addition. The hardest thing I've ever done is pot and that is extremely rare and I've only done it to fall asleep. I guess the advice I'm asking is what can I do or say if this happens to come up again? What can I tell her to let you know how much I love and support her and that I'm on her side?

Thanks."
addiction,The-Wild-Hunt,2020/1/24,"I¡¯m addicted to sex/prostitution This has to be one of my worst additions ever and idk how I can combat this. It has ruined relationships I¡¯ve had and ruined my financial life wasting so much money to pay escorts. 

It has been putting me down this deep hole of shame and guilt 
It¡¯s internally killing my soul."
addiction,keeshneesh,2020/3/29,"I need support to take the big leap     During this lock down I have had a lot of time to think. I lost my job (I was a server at a restaurant in Ohio). I have been taking suboxone for close to 3-4 years. While it has really helped me, and brought my life back to something that is somewhat normal, I hate needing it everyday, and I feel like it¡¯s holding me back in life in so many ways. 

    I¡¯ve heard about vivitrol, and I think I need to take this time I don¡¯t have to work to stop taking suboxone long enough that they will give me the vivitrol shot. That week is gonna suck, but I think it will help me feel less like I¡¯m still a drug addict, and I¡¯ll be able to apply to jobs that drug test or even join the military (which I have considered often, as a way to go back to school for free and give me structure and a new social group and way of life that will benefit me). 

    I have a criminology degree (I graduated in December 2018) but I haven¡¯t even tried to apply anywhere in related fields because I still feel like I¡¯m not good enough, and I know that drug tests will be required, and often suboxone is one of the drugs they test for. I also want to go back to school for something different, I feel like criminology was a poor choice I made because I didn¡¯t know what I was doing when I started college at 18. It¡¯s not the degree that I would choose now, and most of the jobs i could get with that degree don¡¯t appeal to me. 

   I just need some support or guidance on how to do this. I don¡¯t have health insurance, but I applied to Medicaid and food stamps since I got laid off, I¡¯ll check tomorrow to see where I¡¯m at with that. 

  Reddit help me if you cared enough to read this, any support, suggestions, or guidance would be greatly appreciated."
addiction,rach_mentalhealth,2020/3/7,"Survey to help with addiction In the spirit of recovery and the difficulties associated with it, I¡¯m sharing a survey to be completed by anyone who is/is not yet sure whether they want to address their addiction. It¡¯s meant to hopefully clarify one¡¯s goals and steps that would be required.

https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/77RNVZZ

It doesn¡¯t take alot of time and would be very helpful! 

Thanks and hope everyone has a nice weekend :) (no names are collected on this survey so no need to worry about that either!)"
addiction,I-Concentrate-E,2020/1/6,"I am so sick of my self medicating self aware self sustaining addiction to death ""Self awareness is just talk, you can't know who you are until you become it."" -Devil

Oh my god I just realized that I'm the devil, I'm a coke addict lying to my family, friends, ex-lovers, myself, and the rest of the world that I'm trying to get better. Yet in between the inhales of coke in one snort and the exhales of snot, I'm still looking for that missing piece.

I'm still searching the floor pathetically from the crumbs and desiring for more. I know how this came about, how I became a coke slinging mind numbing and thought bending construct. I started by destroying my sense of self, isolating through depression, and crippled with anxiety I tried to medicate my-self away and tried to keep walking forward until I would trip over it.

Because the dumbest thing in the world is to escape the inevitable, change. So I'm the fucking devil, I'm the one manifesting into these shitty futures by hiding in my room like a goblin. I'm the asshole who chose drugs over my girlfriend and then my boyfriend, and then my mother, and then my sisters, and then my friends.

I'm that dick and I refuse to take responsibility for my-self, I've been trying to get that thing away from me and when I stopped therapy I realized just how flawed and hopeless I am. I am so frighteningly self aware that I live with crippling anxiety that morphs into depression and became the face of my hopelessness in addiction. I've gotten better in some sense, I've only done a gram this week.

My all time high was 4g in 2 days and Perocet pills scattered throughout and filling the gaps with random psychedelics to reflect on my glory days. Well I have a message to deliver to you, you hurt yourself by never asking for help.

You die endlessly and pointlessly by wasting your time, everything you made is meaningless and if anything harmful to your well being. Why do you choose to live like this? Give me a fucking reason, or get out town tonight and get a job, go back to school and learn something this time, and if you don't do something then shut up.

""I saw all the signs but I didn't do anything, this was going to be a problem from the beginning. I wish I had better guides and tried to combine awareness with hope."" -God

I'm lying I'm not really god, because I did have good guides and awareness, I just didn't have hope. I want to get better and honestly for myself because I'm too much of a dumb shit to kill myself already so I might as well just try to live for myself for once. 

All this came to ahead when I tripped on acid last week and I had this weird moment where everyone in my life was looking straight at me but there eyes were darted away. Like they didn't want to look at me and I wanted to get angry that they weren't looking at me, no one was seeing my suffering. 

I was like a little kid threatening to die but slowly because she was too much a child to go through with it. When you see someone jump and almost hit the pavement, empathy makes you close your eyes at the last second. To spare you the trauma. 

God I can't believe I ever thought it was anyone else's fault, everyone I love tried to help me but I never wanted any of that. I am struggling constantly in a process of having faith in the cocaine and loneliness as a substitute for everything I've lost, 

""There's no going back now, the only way for me to continue is forward"" and ""I want to back and change everything I did wrong"" 

Neither of these are realistic conclusions on how to deal with life, I am hopefully going to start therapy again this month and try to find new habits to establish and learn to circumvent this cycle of depression-anxiety-hopelessness-drug abuse backflip justify everything rinse and repeat reflect what have I done! HEY FUCK YOU, I'M DONE."
addiction,AliensAreHere2,2020/2/20,"Quit opiates a little over a week ago and today is day one off adderall I have had an issue with opiates for about 8 months. I got off them a few times but it never lasted. The last run I was abusing tramadol, codeine, gabapentin and adderall. And before that was just Norco and adderall. I believe that my opiate use stems from adderall tho, as I first started liking opiates because it would help me manage the comedown. I started lieing to my girlfriend, then my mom, and then I even started lieing to myself about my use. I kept making excuses for what I was doing. I caused so many issues between me, my gf, and my family that are probably unfixable. The only solution I have found was to just cut out the issue completely and to make sure it never happens again."
addiction,Amaxophobe,2020/1/18,"Can you help identify what addiction we are dealing with? We were sure he (brother in law) started with cocaine. Signs included talking nonstop, boasting about himself, nosebleeds, chatterbox, sprouted with angry bursts and isolating people, high for days but mostly functioning. Lost 40 lbs quickly. Still drinking all day starting at 9 AM. Total asshole and not himself.

But the past couple of months, things have shifted drastically.

Where he was noticeably high but still functioning, now he babbles and is borderline incoherent ¡ª but he still goes like crazy (snow blowing in -40 for 4 hrs for example).

Where he was functioning, now he doesn¡¯t work at all nor pay his bills.

Where he would go a couple days high and a couple days down, now he goes a full week high and this time going on two weeks down.

He has lost another 30 lbs and looks emaciated.

He has isolated everyone. Lies about literally everything. Doesn¡¯t work, doesn¡¯t pay bills, lies through his teeth. Where he used to also drink and chew tobacco, now he seems to only use whatever drug he¡¯s on. We can¡¯t get any useful information from him or his wife. He is being enabled left right and centre.

To the point that he has clients calling him with no answer, some he has made pick up keys to his shop, get their deliverables themselves, and drop the keys back off while he remains comatose on the couch.

He doesn¡¯t pay any bills yet he bought himself a brand new truck, then decked it all out, then bought new dirt bikes for his kids, etc all while never working and saying he has no money. 

He routinely is permitted to drive his kids while fucked up and basically just perpetually continue this week up two weeks down pattern.

We have tried to tell his parents but they just fight us like we are delusional.

What are we dealing with? What is he on? What can we do?"
addiction,ilikemycrazy,2020/1/1,Mississippi Just curious. Anyone here from the ¡®Sip?
addiction,_maybe__not,2020/4/6,"Struggling with blaming my boyfriend for his addiction My boyfriend had/has a weed addiction. He¡¯s managed to quit for the last three weeks and of course I¡¯m really happy about this. 

The problem is that I still feel resentful towards him for getting addicted and the way he treated me while addicted. I know that blaming people for their addiction is wrong, and I even semi-understand why my boyfriend got addicted in the first place, he was struggling to deal with something horrible that happened to him a couple of years ago. I¡¯m not trying to bash anyone with an addiction here, I just genuinely need some advice/insight into how addiction works.

I¡¯m resentful that I can¡¯t occasionally get stoned with him now and that we can¡¯t have sex while stoned sometimes like we used to, which was great. It feels like he¡¯s ruined something that was fun for us and for me, I don¡¯t have any friends who smoke so he was the only person I could get stoned with. 

I¡¯m resentful about how he lied to me. I¡¯ve never felt like I couldn¡¯t trust him before this, it¡®s a strange feeling. He lied about how often he was smoking, and I thought he was getting better a couple of times only to find out he¡¯d been lying to me and was still smoking every night. He would also lie about if he was stoned or not, I couldn¡¯t even tell if he was anymore.

I¡¯m resentful about how he messed with my head. When I first brought up how I was worried about his smoking, he made it seem like there was no problem at all and that I was being controlling. I was so sure I was right but then I really started doubting myself and didn¡¯t bring it up again for a while.

I¡¯m resentful about how he pressured me into smoking with him, and how he guilt tripped me into giving back his weed even when he was trying to quit. 

I¡¯m resentful about the person he became while addicted. He became boring, unmotivated and his only hobby was smoking weed. I love him, but I really didn¡¯t love who he was becoming. 

I¡¯m resentful about how it affected our sex life. He couldn¡¯t get it up properly without being stoned, I think he had just gotten used to feeling of being stoned and jerking off loads. One time (that I know of), he told me he wasn¡¯t stoned and we had sex. I was really happy because he kept his boner, but turns out he lied to me and he was actually stoned. For some reason I felt a bit violated by this. 

I know that this is an unhelpful, bad mindset and the things I mentioned above are because of his addiction, not him, but I¡¯m struggling to deal with these feelings. I don¡¯t want to bring this up to him because I don¡¯t want him to feel guilty. Any advice would be appreciated greatly."
addiction,awalakaiehu,2020/3/18,"Lawrence from Intervention Season 4 Episode 10, Lawrence's story was very moving for me. I'm trying to find where i can see this episode online?
Specifically, Lawrence mentioned a sort of apparition of a woman that he would see that he had a name for. I'm trying to remember this name, its a long story but its very important to me. If anyone could recall the name or direct me to somewhere I can rewatch the episode I would appreciate it so much!"
addiction,mahboahlenah,2020/2/1,"I never realized how dependent I had become on alcohol I¡¯ve always been a pretty heavy drinker compared to people around me. When I first started college I would have a drink of some sort just about everyday. It just mellowed me out and made me feel good. Overtime I¡¯ve reduced that number and for the most part, I only drink socially with friends or when im on my own time. I¡¯ve become much more responsible with it. 

Last night was when the realization hit me that I might have a problem. The coin fell the wrong way and I was designated driver for my group of friends. I was fine with this, as I wanted them to enjoy their time. 

When we got to the club, however, I couldn¡¯t bring myself to have a good time. Completely sober, I danced to a few songs, socialized within my group, but that was pretty much the extent of my night. Usually I am the fun one, the one who doesn¡¯t care if people make fun of their dancing, doesn¡¯t care about how many strangers they meet. I felt so different this time, like I couldn¡¯t bring myself to have as much fun as I usually would. 

I¡¯ve always known that I drink too much, but never considered myself dependent on it until now. I guess the first part of addiction is recognizing it, and yesterday certainly helped with that."
